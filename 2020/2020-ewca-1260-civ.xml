Following a lengthy trial at the Central Criminal Court, the defendant was convicted by the jury on 13 June 2014 of nine offences of fraud. The trial judge, Judge Hone QC, sentenced him to 8 years imprisonment. An appeal against conviction was subsequently rejected by a constitution of the Criminal Division of this court. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The prosecutor then commenced confiscation proceedings under the 1988 Act (because of the dates of the frauds alleged, antedating 24 March 2003, the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, “the 2002 Act”, did not, as throughout was common ground, apply). In the result, a confiscation order was made by Judge Hone QC on 12 January 2016 in the amount of £20,434,691. The total benefit had been assessed in that amount. As to available assets, certain assets were identified. As to the balance, the court made a finding of hidden assets and determined the recoverable amount to be not less than the value of the benefit from the relevant criminal conduct, that is £20,434,691. A confiscation order was made accordingly, with a term of 10 years imprisonment imposed in default of payment. In addition, the judge was invited to exercise his power under s. 130 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and s. 72 (7) of the 1988 Act to make confiscation orders in favour of the prosecutor, Mr Mirchandani, and a Mr Shah. The judge did so, in the amount of £18,220,723 and £200,233 respectively. The balance of the confiscation order represented the remaining assets of the defendant, in circumstances where the criminal lifestyle provisions had been applied. The judge directed, under s.72 (7) of the 1988 Act, that any money realised under the confiscation order should first be paid to satisfy the compensation orders. A subsequent application for leave to appeal against the confiscation order was unsuccessful. </p>

Significant sums had been paid by the defendant into bank accounts in the name of his (by now former) wife, Alka Gheewala. The prosecutor was claiming that these were to be regarded as tainted gifts for the purposes of the 1988 Act. Directions were given by Spencer J for a hearing of that issue. By the time of that hearing, the only extant dispute related to seven transfers of money to Ms Gheewala between April and August 2010. </p>

There was a four day hearing before Jefford J, sitting in the Queen’s Bench Division, in May 2017. At that hearing, each of the prosecutor, the defendant and Ms Gheewala was represented by counsel.  </p>

After detailed consideration of the background and the evidence, the judge decided there had been no gifts as such: rather the money in question had beneficially remained the defendant’s money and had been transferred into his wife’s account for his own convenience, primarily out of money legitimately acquired by him as a consequence of a settlement of certain legal proceedings in Kenya. </p>

The Lord Chancellor raised objections on jurisdictional grounds to the Order of 25 May 2018, as to which he had had no previous opportunity to make representations. He sought to have that Order set aside. The Lord Chancellor was given leave to intervene accordingly. It was the outcome of that intervention that led to the Order of the judge, following a hearing at which the prosecutor and the Lord Chancellor were represented, which is the subject of this present appeal. For Jefford J, in a detailed and careful reserved judgment dated 15 May 2019, decided that her previous decision was wrong and that she should set aside her previous Order of 25 May 2018. The judge’s decision was ultimately reflected in an amended Order sealed on 1 August 2019; and it is against that Order that this appeal is brought by the prosecutor.  </p>

Section 83 relates to circumstances in which the High Court may issue a certificate of inadequacy: where such a certificate is issued, then, on application made, the Crown Court (or Magistrates’ Court, as the case may be) is required to substitute for the recoverable amount such lesser amount as it thinks just, and with any consequential appropriate adjustment to the default term of imprisonment. </p>

But that, he argued, was not determinative. What matters is what s. 17 of the 1985 Act actually provides. If it was intended that an order for costs out of central funds could not be made in such proceedings but could only be made in proceedings designated as criminal proceedings then s. 17 could and would have so provided. But it does not. Instead it uses what he said is deliberately broad language: “any proceedings in respect of an indictable offence”. He stressed, in particular, the words “any proceedings” and the words “in respect of” an indictable offence. </p>

Mr Cohen, on the other hand, said that the word was only capable of extending to legal costs and disbursements incurred by the prosecutor pursuant to Regulation 7, as well as, where relevant, any travelling expenses or subsistence allowance (he also, in this regard, referred us to Regulation 24 and Regulation 18 of the 1986 Regulations).

The solicitors then sought to have their costs paid out of central funds. For this purpose, they did not seek to invoke any jurisdiction under the 1985 Act.

Such orders may affect the property or obligations not only of the person against whom they are made but of third parties as well. Thus the consequences of an order in criminal proceedings may be a claim or dispute which is essentially civil in character.

They are no more separate from the original criminal proceedings than is the application for a confiscation order itself. They are not fresh proceedings involving the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of Article 6.1 , any more than are the proceedings by which the prosecutor seeks a confiscation order. Article 6.1 applies because, as [counsel] rightly accepts, the enforcement proceedings are part of the criminal proceedings.

Such Practice Direction, both by its terms and by its status as a Practice Direction and by its date – 30 years after the 1985 Act – seems to me to provide very limited assistance on the issues of statutory interpretation arising on this appeal.

On the one hand, even if the power to conduct "criminal proceedings" is not derived from section 6, section 17 is most obviously concerned with the costs of a private party who pursues such criminal proceedings and is, therefore, limited to costs of criminal proceedings. So far as defence costs are concerned, section 16 is clearly limited to various types of criminal proceedings and it could be expected that section 17 would have a similar scope. It would be surprising if the defendant's costs could only be recovered out of central funds in what are obviously criminal proceedings and not in proceedings in the High Court or on appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal Civil Division whilst the prosecutor's costs could be recovered in the High Court and on appeal. On the other hand, if that is right, the wording of section 17 need only have referred to criminal proceedings (or contained a similar list of proceedings to that in section 16) but instead a broader expression "in respect of an indictable offence" is employed. That expression is capable, for example, of referring to criminal proceedings before the Court of Appeal Criminal Division but there is also a persuasive reason why an even broader meaning ought to be ascribed to the words used. As submitted on behalf of the prosecutor, that is because there is a public interest in the enforcement of confiscation orders and under section 80 of the CJA the application for the appointment of a receiver may only be made by the "prosecutor".” </p>

However, the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Belhaj) v Director of Public Prosecutions (No. 1) </span>[2018] UKSC 33, [2019] AC 593 has, of course, since been the subject of clarification and explanation in <span style="font-style:italic">In re McGuinness </span>[2020] UKSC 6, [2020] 2 WLR 510.

Here, the defendant had been convicted at trial in the Crown Court of fraud: an indictable offence. The trial proceedings unquestionably were “in respect of” an indictable offence. The ensuing confiscation proceedings, part of the overall sentencing process which culminated in the confiscation order, were themselves likewise unquestionably “in respect of” an indictable offence. It seems to me to be very odd and strained then to say that, nevertheless, enforcement proceedings which are designed to give effect to the confiscation order are somehow <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>“in respect of” an indictable offence. It is too restricted an approach, in my opinion, to say that such proceedings are, and only are, in respect of the confiscation proceedings.

Absent authority, I see no sufficient basis for so reading that sub-section. It is quite true that in s. 6 the preservation of the right to institute and conduct private prosecutions is in terms geared to “criminal proceedings”. But that, if anything, tells against his argument. Section 17 (1) (a) could, for example, readily have been restricted expressly to criminal proceedings if that was what was intended. But it is not: on the contrary, it in terms relates to <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>(emphasis added) proceedings in respect of an indictable offence. Moreover, that is to be contrasted with s. 17 (1) (b). That sub-section, in the context of summary offences, is limited to the Divisional Court or the House of Lords.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Yet further, such an interpretation – to my way of thinking, the natural interpretation – is surely very strongly supported by purposive considerations. The judge in her first judgment had clearly thought that such considerations ultimately were determinative of the point: see her powerful observations in paragraph 12 of her first judgment. In her second judgment, the one now under appeal, this point understandably continued to occupy her mind: see paragraph 47 (i) of that judgment. As she observed, confiscation orders are “toothless” in the absence of adequate enforcement proceedings. There can, as I see it, be no rhyme or reason in permitting a private prosecutor’s costs of confiscation proceedings to be paid out of central funds but then prohibiting such an outcome for enforcement proceedings with regard to the confiscation order so obtained. Indeed, it can also be said that such an outcome would be contrary to the perceived public interest. Parliament has decided that, in appropriate cases, private prosecutions serve a public interest. Parliament has further decided that confiscation proceedings, designed to require a criminal to disgorge the proceeds of his criminality, also serve a public interest. Yet if a private prosecutor can never get any costs of enforcement proceedings out of central funds that would operate as a very substantial deterrent to initiating confiscation proceedings in the first place. It is very difficult to think that that would accord with the presumed Parliamentary intention.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That point, in fact, has particular focus in the present case. It will be recalled that by the confiscation order made by Judge Hone QC in the Crown Court, the judge had directed that compensation to the victims of the fraud (Mr Shah, as well as the private prosecutor) should first be paid out of the sums recovered out of the confiscated amount. It is a further aspect of the public interest, under the legislative scheme, that where practicable victims should be compensated for the fraud (or other related criminality) inflicted on them. Indeed, such an order remains under the purview of the Crown Court throughout. But, as pointed out by the President of the Queen’s Bench Division in argument, that further public interest would also stand to be undermined if the prosecutor is not able to recover costs of enforcement proceedings out of central funds. Given the practical realities of defendants in such cases claiming to be without assets and not co-operating in the (necessary) enforcement process, it is a hollow argument indeed to say that the remedy, where the enforcement proceedings are successful, is to be left solely to an order for recovery of costs from the defendant himself pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules Part 44. </p>

There has never been an exact equivalence between s. 16 (whether in its original form or in its amended form) and s. 17 (whether in its original form or its amended form). The circumstances in which a defendant can recover costs out of central funds have, generally speaking, in criminal cases always tended to be more circumscribed than those applicable to a prosecutor. The policy and pragmatic considerations for this differentiation in the present situation are not difficult to discern. As pointed out by a constitution of this court in the subsequent costs decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">Zinga </span>litigation, and after reference to the decision of the Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Law Society) v Lord Chancellor </span>[2010] EWHC 1406 (Admin), [2011] 1 WLR 234, there are policy reasons why provisions governing payment to a private prosecutor may be more favourable than those applying to a defendant: namely, a desire not to deter private prosecutions: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Virgin Media Ltd) v Zinga </span>[2014] EWCA Crim 1823, [2014] 5 Costs L. R. 879 at paragraph 20 of the judgment. Indeed, that differentiation has become even more pronounced by virtue of the amendments made to s. 16 and s. 17 by the 2012 Act. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge was also concerned that the 1986 Regulations, made pursuant to the 1985 Act, did not provide any mechanism for the determination of costs out of central funds in proceedings before a single judge of the High Court: whereas in other respects such means of determination are available. I accept that it is legitimate to take into account the 1986 Regulations in considering the interpretation of the 1985 Act itself and I accept that this is a point, particularly having regard to s. 17 (2C) (b) of the 1985 Act, favouring the respondent’s interpretation. But, as I see it, the 1986 Regulations cannot operate to distort the meaning of s. 17 (1) (a) if otherwise not ambiguous. Besides, it cannot be assumed that the 1985 Act, and 1986 Regulations made thereunder, were drafted with the confiscation provisions, let alone the enforcement provisions, of the subsequent 1988 Act, or Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, specifically in mind. Moreover, the lack of provision for such determination does not leave a gaping lacuna in the legislative scheme, if read so as to extend to enforcement proceedings in the High Court. For the statutory provisions are to the effect that the court itself is empowered to fix the amount. Overall, in fact, as I see it, the real lacuna would be if the legislation did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>permit recovery of costs of enforcement proceedings out of central funds. </p>

It is true that the concession of counsel in that case that subsequent proceedings to enforce the confiscation order by a warrant of committal formed “part and parcel of the original criminal proceedings” was accepted. Since the present case also involves enforcement of the confiscation order there is indeed, it can be said, a broad analogy. Nevertheless, Dyson LJ was careful to stress that the actual decision related to, and was confined to, enforcement by way of summons for the issue of a warrant to commit: and that there had been no argument on the civil methods of enforcement (paragraph 24 of the judgment).  </p>

But Cranston J expressly qualified that by saying that that was so for the purpose of the Access to Justice Act 1999 and related 2001 Regulations.

Indeed, as Dr Friston submitted and I agree, the enforcement proceedings are, in truth, civil proceedings of a rather special kind. Not only, for example, do they – on any view – take place in a criminal context and flow from a criminal conviction and confiscation order, but also they are proceedings which only the “prosecutor” may bring (and he plainly does so in his capacity as prosecutor) and where the criminal defendant is, under RSC O.115, required to be made a party. This is also reinforced by the fact that, under the legislation, the criminal proceedings remain extant until the confiscation order is satisfied; and the Crown Court retains an overall role. Thus, for example, where a certificate of inadequacy is made in the High Court then the matter is referred back to the Crown Court for adjustment of the default sentence of imprisonment. Moreover, a confiscation order enures to the benefit of the Crown: and that remains so in a case such as the present, where the amount of the confiscation order exceeds the amount of the compensation order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Such a conclusion, in my opinion, also coheres with, indeed is reinforced by, the position arising under the 2002 Act and with confiscation and enforcement proceedings thereunder. This is particularly so where (a) the 2002 Act now expressly confers the relevant jurisdiction in enforcement proceedings on the Crown Court and (b) the Criminal Procedure Rules expressly include provisions relating to confiscation enforcement proceedings (as well as to payment out of central funds): connoting that such enforcement proceedings, even if hybrid in nature, are properly to be treated as part of a “criminal case”. There is no obvious policy reason at all why the 2002 Act, and rules thereunder, should have been designed to have a different outcome for this purpose from that arising under the 1988 Act. </p>

That clearly must be taken as being of wider import than the mere recovery of travel or out of pocket expenses as such. I did not understand Mr Cohen to dispute, on this aspect of the case, that it would at least extend (subject always to the requirement of reasonableness) to the legal costs of the private prosecutor in retaining lawyers to pursue the confiscation and enforcement proceedings. That also accords with the heading to the section. </p>

That is, on a natural reading of the section, an “expense” incurred in proceedings in respect of an indictable offence. I can also see nothing in the 1986 Regulations which would tell against such a conclusion. Such a conclusion, moreover, would also align with the position of a public prosecutor: who will, directly or indirectly, be able to have recourse to public funds to meet any liability in costs to a third party. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With respect, many of Mr Cohen’s arguments on this issue really seemed to come down to arguing that it was not fair or reasonable for Ms Gheewala’s costs to come out of public funds. He noted, by way of example, that the statutory provisions and the order of appointment of the enforcement receiver in the present case would have permitted Ms Bartlett, as enforcement receiver, herself to have pursued the enforcement proceedings. However, under the legislative scheme the yardstick for recovery is reasonableness, not success. It is, of course, a very important qualification to the recovery of such costs out of central funds that they be appropriately and reasonably incurred. But that is a separate issue from the issue of whether the court has any power (in the sense of jurisdiction) to make such an order at all. If it does - and my view is that it does - then it was common ground before us that this court is not itself in a position to make such a determination. Mr Cohen’s points of this nature can thus be left for consideration at that further stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In her first judgment, the judge decided that the costs payable to Ms Gheewala were in principle payable and had been properly and reasonably incurred. However, the Lord Chancellor – who, as custodian of public funds for this purpose, is the party with ultimate responsibility for the discharge of these costs – had not participated in the first hearing and had no opportunity to make representations on reasonableness, whether in terms of the undertaking and pursuit of these enforcement proceedings relating to the alleged tainted gifts to Ms Gheewala or in terms of quantum. I thus would remit this issue (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will extend to the prosecutor’s own costs, as well as those ordered to be paid to Ms Gheewala) to the High Court for further determination. </p>

Lord Bridge, with whom all the other members of the judicial committee agreed, considered (in his own words at p. 33G) “in some detail the nature, context and provenance of the legislative provisions in which jurisdiction is specifically conferred to award payment of costs out of central funds”. His conclusion (at p. 37 A/B quoted by Davis LJ above) was: </p>

The conclusion of Davis LJ at [91] above is that enforcement proceedings are “proceedings in respect of an indictable offence” and, in that respect, the words of section 17(1)(a) are clear and explicit. </p>

There is nothing in the 2002 Act itself which provides for the costs of enforcing a confiscation order to be paid out of central funds. There is, however, in Part 33 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, which is headed “Confiscation and Related Proceedings”, express provision addressing the making of costs in restraint or receivership proceedings. It makes no provision for payment out of central funds but, on the contrary, provides for the court to exercise a discretion for payment of costs between the parties in terms which mirror Part 44 of the Civil Procedure Rules.  </p>
