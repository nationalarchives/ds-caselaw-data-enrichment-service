	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In 1988, Parliament legislated to unify the rates of tax on income and capital gains: see section 98 of the Finance Act 1988. In principle, that then remained the position for 20 years until 2008, when a single rate of capital gains tax (“CGT”) of 18% was introduced with effect from the tax year 2008/09.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This case concerns a relief from the higher rates of income tax, usually known as corresponding deficiency relief (“CDR”), in the tax years 2006/07 and 2007/08. At that time, there was no upper limit to the amount of CDR which a taxpayer could use, in the year in which it arose, to set against his income for that year which would otherwise have been chargeable to higher rate income tax. The effect of the relief was that the income in question was instead charged to income tax at the basic rate. The issue, in short, is whether the taxpayer was also entitled to a similar reduction in the amount of his chargeable gains for the same year which would otherwise have been liable to CGT at the higher rate of 40%, with the result that those gains were instead charged to CGT at the lower rate of 20%.  </p>

On the assumption that his liability to CGT at the higher rate could not be reduced by CDR in the same way as his liability to higher rate income tax was admittedly reduced, the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) issued closure notices on 13 February 2015 requiring Mr Scott to pay CGT of approximately £9.42 million for the two years.  </p>

For the purposes of Chapter 9, a gain is treated as arising on the occurrence of specified “chargeable events”, including the surrender or part surrender of the policy: sections 462 and 484. The amount of the gain is calculated in accordance with a detailed and rigid set of rules, contained in sections 491 and following. It has often been observed that those rules are capable of operating in a way which produces apparently arbitrary results contrary to commercial reality: see, for example, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mayes v Revenue and Customs Commissioners</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 407, [2011] STC 1269, at [38] and [49] (Mummery LJ) and [102] to [104] (Toulson LJ), referring to the legislation as it stood before its restatement with minor changes in ITTOIA 2005.  </p>

The charge to tax is at the higher rate only, because section 530(1) confers a credit for basic rate tax on the chargeable amount. This credit reflects the fact that the insurance company is in principle liable for tax at the basic rate on the investment gain attributable to the policy which accrues while it remains in force.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Section 539 of ITTOIA 2005 is headed “Relief for deficiencies”. Its purpose (broadly stated) is to confer relief from higher rate income tax in circumstances where a final chargeable event gives rise, not to a gain, but (by application of the same computational rules) to an arithmetical loss, or “deficiency”.  This is likely to happen, for example, on the surrender or termination of a policy, after an earlier part surrender has generated a heavily “front-loaded” gain of the type described by Mummery LJ in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Mayes</span>. The earlier gain is allowed as a deduction in the computation of the deficiency under section 541, and if the amount realised on termination is comparatively small (because the part surrender exhausted much of the value of the policy), the deficiency may be correspondingly large. </p>

This negative figure is in turn deducted from the basic rate limit as required by section 4, having the effect of extending the basic rate band beyond the basic rate limit.

If that proposition holds good, it is then said that the very large amounts of CDR to which Mr Scott was admittedly entitled in each tax year (some £20.2 million in 2006/07, and £22.6 million in the following year) operate to provide relief from CGT as if his basic rate band had been extended by the same amount, with the consequence that all gains falling within the extended band are chargeable to tax at the lower rate of 20% instead of the higher rate of 40%. </p>

Accordingly, when making the deduction required by section 6(2), one must deduct the full amount of the CDR referred to in section 6(2)(a) and, if that produces a negative figure, so be it.

On that footing, it is hard to see how any part of Mr Scott’s basic rate band could have remained unused for CGT purposes. This point was not taken by HMRC, however, and we heard no argument on it. The explanation may be that we have an incomplete picture of Mr Scott’s actual income tax position in 2006/07, precisely because the question of principle has throughout been argued on assumed figures. Furthermore, the apparent difficulty which I have mentioned clearly does not arise in 2007/08, when the CDR of approximately £22.6 million available to Mr Scott was on any view far greater than his total income of about £8 million.

As Mr Pritchard submitted for HMRC, Parliament has not chosen to assimilate the structure and reliefs of the two taxes, and as a matter of substance they continue to operate in separate spheres. I am therefore satisfied that it would be wrong in principle to approach the construction of section 6(2) on the basis that a way should if possible be found to permit the CDR, which (ex hypothesi) has already been used to reduce the taxpayer’s higher rate income tax liability, to bring about a similar reduction in his higher rate CGT liability. That would be to turn a relief from income tax into a corresponding relief from CGT as well. I can find no indication that such an intention should be attributed to Parliament. If that had indeed been the legislative intention, one would expect to find clear and specific provision to that effect in language similar to that used in section 539 of ITTOIA 2005, rather than a special provision ostensibly concerned only with the rates of charge to CGT. </p>

Leaving aside section 6(2), the effect of section 4(4) is merely to treat the unused part (if any) of a taxpayer’s income tax basic rate band as transferable when computing his liability to CGT. Thus, for example, if his total income (after deductions) were £25,000, and the basic rate limit were £40,000, he would be able to transfer the unused £15,000 of his basic rate band to cover the first £15,000 of his chargeable gains.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">How, then, does the hypothesis in section 6(2) impact on that basic situation? We are told that section 4(4) is to have effect <span style="font-style:italic">as if</span> the taxpayer’s “income for the year” were reduced by the amount of the CDR for which he had obtained relief from higher rate income tax. Since section 4(4) is concerned with ascertaining the difference between a person’s total income and the basic rate limit, I consider that the word “income” in the final limb of section 6(2) must also refer to the taxpayer’s total income. Indeed, Mr Furness appeared to accept this. Thus the effect of the hypothesis is that, for the purposes of section 4(4), the CDR is now to be treated as a deduction from the taxpayer’s total income. The deeming is needed in order to achieve this purpose, because section 539 of ITTOIA 2005 does not by itself create a deduction from total income, despite the rather misleading appearance to the contrary in the wording of subsection (1). As we have seen, the deduction merely applies for the limited purpose of determining the taxpayer’s liability to higher rate income tax: section 539(3). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Reverting to section 4(4), if the taxpayer’s total income, as (now) reduced by CDR, amounts to less than his basic rate limit, the unused portion of the basic rate band will afford relief from CGT at the higher rate in the way I have described. Returning to the simple example in [30] above, suppose that the taxpayer’s total income (after deductions other than CDR) were £525,000, and he had available CDR of £500,000. The effect of the relief, for income tax purposes, would then have been to eliminate his liability to higher rate tax. In fact, he would only have needed to use so much of the CDR as reduced his total income to £40,000, i.e. £485,000. But another way of looking at it would be to say that he used the entire CDR of £500,000, leaving £25,000 to set against his basic rate limit. Either way, the effect of the calculation in section 4(4), as modified by section 6(2), is to ensure that the taxpayer can have the benefit of an amount equal to the unused part of his basic rate band when computing his liability to CGT.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Further than that, in my view, section 6(2) does not go. Once the taxpayer’s total income has been notionally reduced to zero in the section 6(2) calculation, the relief affordable by the CDR can go no further. There is no longer any income which can be reduced, because negative total income is not a meaningful concept. As Mr Pritchard said in his admirably clear written and oral submissions, the amount of a deduction is not necessarily the same as the amount of available relief, because the deduction cannot exceed the amount needed to extinguish the extra liability that existed before the deduction. Further, as a matter of the ordinary use of language, “income” denotes a positive sum or amount of money or money’s worth, whereas “negative income” is not income at all but would be a form of outgoings or loss.  </p>

If Parliament had wished to extend the taxpayer’s basic rate band for the purposes of the charge to CGT by the full amount of the CDR which the taxpayer was able to use for income tax purposes, it would have said so clearly and explicitly. Indeed, as Mr Pritchard pointed out, the natural way of achieving such an objective would have been by expressly extending the taxpayer’s basic rate limit, as it did in relation to Gift Aid in section 414 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Mr Furness advanced various arguments about the assumed statutory purpose, and sought to criticise the UT for failing to distinguish between Parliament’s general aim of unifying the rates of income and CGT, which the UT thought could not control the interpretation of section 6(2), on the one hand, and a statutory purpose of rate unification, which he submitted should be applied so as to guide the choice between two possible constructions of section 6(2), on the other hand.  </p>

I agree with HMRC that there is no ambiguity in section 6(2), or in the way in which it interacts with section 4(4), so this is not a case where purposive considerations enable the court to choose between two rival constructions the one which is more likely to represent Parliament’s intention. Nor do I think it matters whether the unification of tax rates is described as a general aim or a purpose of the relevant legislation. It is always necessary to begin by construing the actual wording which Parliament has used, in its full legislative context. </p>
