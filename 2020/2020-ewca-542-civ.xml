Consequently, EU Council Directive 2002/90/EC of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence requires Member States to adopt sanctions against “any person who, for financial gain, intentionally assists a person who is not a national of a Member State to reside within the territory of a Member State in breach of the laws of the State concerned on the residence of aliens” which are “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” (articles 1 and 3).   </p>

It prohibits landlords in the private rental sector – of whom there an estimated two million in the UK – from letting their properties to those who are not British, EEA or Swiss citizens and who (i) require but do not have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom or (ii) have such leave but only upon condition that prevents them from occupying such premises (collectively, </p>

This is one of a battery of provisions designed to encourage those who are resident in the UK to regularise their immigration status or leave the country, which include restrictions on employment, using NHS facilities, and obtaining bank accounts, driving licences etc.  These are generally known as the “compliant environment” or, more usually, “hostile environment” provisions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.57in">The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (“the Joint Council”), an independent charity, is a particular advocate for fairness, equality and proper respect for human dignity for immigrants.  On 8 February 2018, it issued judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of State challenging the lawfulness of the Scheme, on the basis that its provisions are incompatible with article 14 when read with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”).  It is important to note the nature of the challenge.  It was not brought by any individual claiming that he or she has been the victim of discrimination as a result of the operation of the Scheme: rather, it was a challenge to the validity of the statutory provisions themselves.  Furthermore, the challenge was not in respect of any adverse effect of the Scheme upon those towards whom it was directed (i.e. irregular immigrants whose right to rent was deliberately curtailed by the Scheme), but the alleged unintended but (it is said) inevitable discriminatory consequences for certain categories of those with a right of abode or leave to enter/remain and thus a right to rent, namely those without British passports and especially those without British passports and without ethnically British attributes such as name. </p>

By section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”) in its original form, it was an offence punishable by a fine and/or up to six months’ imprisonment for someone knowingly to harbour anyone whom he knew or had reasonable cause to believe was an illegal immigrant.  By section 143 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, section 25 of the 1971 Act was replaced by a new provision under which it was a criminal offence to do an act which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law by an individual who was not a citizen of the EU knowing or having reasonable cause for believing (i) that the act facilitates the commission of a breach of immigration law by that individual and (ii) that the individual was not a citizen of the EU.  In parallel with these provisions, Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and Schedule 3 to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 restricted welfare support, including housing benefit, for irregular immigrants.     </p>

It enforces that restriction by prohibiting landlords from renting accommodation to irregular immigrants, and imposing sanctions on landlords who do.  It works by making a landlord <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> liable for renting premises to an irregular immigrant or allowing an irregular immigrant to occupy such premises (section 22) and subject to a civil penalty if he does so (section 23); but, unless he knows or reasonably believes a tenant or occupier is an irregular immigrant, he will have an excuse in respect of such a penalty where he can show that (i) he used an agent to let the property or (ii) he complied with certain “prescribed requirements” which essentially oblige a landlord to ask for (and take copies of) certain identity documents.  The obligation is the more burdensome for landlords because (i) it applies, not just to the tenant who enters into the RTA, but to all individuals who the landlord, following appropriate enquiries, may reasonably expect to occupy the premises under the RTA, and (ii) where a tenant or other occupier has a “limited right to rent” (i.e. has time limited leave to remain, and so may become an irregular immigrant during the course of the period of the RTA), the landlord will need to repeat the checks after the longer of one year or the duration of that person’s “limited right to remain” (sections 24(6) and 27 of the 2014 Act).  The potential adverse consequences for a landlord if he breaches section 22 are not however restricted to any civil penalty: there are potential criminal sanctions which may ultimately result in the landlord going to prison and, even if the landlord acted reasonably in making checks etc, he may lose the tenant and even be required to take expensive possession proceedings if it turns out that the tenant was, or becomes, an irregular immigrant.  </p>

The focus of this concern was not upon the effect of the proposals on those in respect of whom it was primarily targeted, i.e. irregular immigrants who are disqualified from renting private accommodation.  Rather, the concern was that the Scheme would unlawfully discriminate against nondisqualified persons who had the right of abode or leave to enter/remain in the UK but did not have a British passport especially if they had attributes (such as name) which were apparently not ethnically British.  The concern was that landlords, facing potentially severe sanctions for breach, would behave defensively and prefer prospective tenants who could easily and unequivocally show that they had the right to live in the UK, and thus the right to rent, by means of a British passport.  </p>

It will be far easier for a landlord to let his or her property to a British/EU national who will simply have to produce their passport to confirm status.  The consultation itself quotes the Department for Communities and Local Government study that indicates more than half of those in private rented accommodation are non-British or Irish residents and that most new migrants are housed in the private rental sector.

Once a person who has time-limited permission to stay in the UK has established their initial and ongoing entitlement to stay, they should not be treated less favourably than others even if further right to rent checks are subsequently required, as prescribed by the Scheme and set out in the code of practice.  Neither should a landlord treat less favourably a prospective tenant who has the required combination of documents showing their right to rent (for example a driving licence with a long UK birth certificate) but does not have a passport.  There should be no need to ask questions about a prospective tenant’s immigration status where it is clear that they have permission to stay here.  Any subsequent further checks need only establish that the tenant is still here with permission.  If a person is not able to produce acceptable documents a landlord should not assume that they are living in the UK illegally.  Subject to business requirements, landlords should try to keep the offer of accommodation open in order to provide a prospective tenant the opportunity to produce documents that will demonstrate their right to rent, but they are not obliged to do so.”  </p>

The mystery shopping exercise used six fictitious potential tenants, namely (i) a White potential tenant with an English accent (a “White shopper”) and (ii) a BME potential tenant with an accent typical of his country of origin (“a BME shopper”), each in one of three scenarios, namely (a)  a student with time-limited leave to remain/right to rent, (b) a UK national divorcee with a permanent right of abode/right to rent but with limited documentation and (c) a low-income single parent family, vulnerably housed but with permanent right of abode or leave to remain/right to rent.

Although it also claimed that there was a violation of article 8, before Martin Spencer J it took (and it maintains) the position that this is essentially a discrimination case which is better viewed in article 14 terms.  I have already indicated the nature of the challenge (see paragraph 4 above): it is a challenge to the validity of the statutory provisions themselves. </p>

Thus, unless a potential occupier has convincing documentation establishing his British/EEA nationality and in particular a passport, it is to be expected that landlords and agents will use proxies instead, the obvious candidates being name, accent, colour and other signifiers of ethnicity.

It appears to be based upon the premise that “most landlords have only one interest, namely letting their property and maximising their income…” (see [70] of the judge’s judgment, quoted at paragraph 51 above) so that “it is rational in the purely economic sense for a landlord to avoid the risks [of letting to a non-British citizen] which he can do by renting to British passport holders” (see [82]). </p>

As Ms Kaufmann rightly stressed – as did Martin Spencer J (see [1] of his judgment) – discrimination on the basis of any protected characteristic is insidious, and on the basis of such sensitive core attributes such as sex, sexual orientation or race is a particular anathema.  Whilst discrimination by landlords on the basis of nationality and/or race as a result of the administrative burdens and enforcement provisions imposed on them by the Scheme may have been foreseeable, or even inevitable (as Ms Kaufmann submitted), I simply do not see how it can be properly be described as “rational” or “logical”. </p>

Despite the “risks” of doing so, on the evidence, at least a majority of landlords manage to comply with the Scheme without unlawfully discriminating against those who are actually or apparently non-British.  Whilst I well understand the pressures on landlords, there is no evidence to explain why the minority discriminate against potential tenants who are actually or apparently not British, in circumstances in which at least half of them can and do comply with the Scheme without being discriminatory.  On the basis of the evidence, contrary to Ms Kaufmann’s submission, discrimination as a result of the Scheme, whilst quite possibly foreseeable, was clearly not inevitable.  Indeed, leaving aside anecdotal evidence, the best (and, it appears, the only) evidence of actual discrimination – as opposed to evidence of likely intent, or evidence based on fictitious (“mystery shopper”) tenants  – is that from the RLA landlord surveys in 2017 and 2018, consistently to the effect that, in the first 30 months of the Scheme being in operation, only 5-6% landlords in practice discriminated in the manner suggested in this claim (paragraphs 41(i) and 42 above).   </p>

However, others appear to me to have some force, e.g. the possible bias as a result of the specificity of documents offered.  The fact that, for one reason or another, none of the exercise results upon which the discrimination claims are based has been replicated also reduces the confidence one can have in them (although, of course, the extent to which other evidence supports the conclusion does increase that level of confidence).    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Similarly, the limitations on the survey exercises are obvious.  Whilst it is said that the surveys relied upon by the Joint Council had no comparator group because no such group was possible after the full roll out in England (and the rental market system in the other home countries is significantly different), it is a fact that, unlike the Secretary of State’s October 2015 survey (see paragraphs 32-34 above), there was no control group.  Furthermore, the samples of the surveys relied upon by the Joint Council (like, I accept, the Secretary of State’s pilot survey in October 2015) were small.  There are about two million private sector landlords in the UK.  The Joint Council February 2017 landlord survey elicited only 108 responses from landlords and another 208 from letting agents.  Of this survey, Mr Asmat observed that “this is a relatively low level of response from which to draw the kind of wide-ranging findings the [Joint Council seek] to do” (paragraph 31 of his 20 August 2018).  Whilst the judge dismissed the force of that “in the face of the consistent and striking picture which emerges from the various large-scale surveys which now exist” (see [95] of his judgment), the RLA surveys approached 65,000 landlords and non-landlord members, as well as seeking responses through websites and social media, and obtained only 2,792 and 2,478 responses respectively.  Those who responded were not selected.  Those conducting the Shelter survey, by drawing the sample from the YouGov panel, attempted to improve the representative nature of the data provided – and were confident that they had obtained a very good representation of private landlords – but, because very little is known about the demographic profile of landlords in the UK, accepted that it was not possible to weight the survey results to be representative of all landlords (see page 6).  The largest survey was the Ministry of Housing’s 2018 survey of about 8,000 private landlords and letting agents registered with one of the government-backed tenancy deposit protection schemes, in which the landlords were selected so that the data obtained could be weighted, which increased confidence in the representative nature of the results.  The RLA surveys drew their sample in a more restrictive way.   </p>

Whilst I appreciate that the surveys (including the Shelter survey) sought to ascertain whether landlords would be <span style="font-style:italic">more likely</span> to let (or consider letting) to people who were not (or who did not appear to be) British, consideration of the evidence as a whole has to take into account the underlying level of discrimination. </p>

Despite the criticisms made on behalf of the Secretary of State and my observations above, on the basis of all the evidence, I am satisfied that, as a result of the Scheme, some landlords do discriminate against potential tenants who do not have British passports, and particularly those who have neither such passports nor ethnically-British attributes such as name.  By “as a result of the Scheme”, I mean that, but for the Scheme, the level of discrimination would be less.  Almost all of the evidence – notably the evidence from mystery shopping exercises and surveys – points clearly in that direction.   </p>

However, this does not make it impossible for those in the category of those discriminated against to get housing: at its highest, the evidence establishes that they will find it harder, in other words, it will take them longer.  Nevertheless, I am asked to draw an inference that, given the scale of discrimination, there will be some who have been unable to find accommodation at all, or for such a long period that their family life has been interfered with.  For the purposes of considering the ambit of article 8, I am prepared to draw that inference<span style="font-size:11.5pt">.”</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree that, on the evidence, this goes too far insofar as it suggests that there will be tenants who are simply unable to find any private accommodation because they lack a British passport.  As the judge himself indicated, the evidence does not suggest that it is impossible for even those against whom landlords discriminate to get private housing at all.  Whilst any discrimination on the basis of status is to be decried, the level of discrimination supported by the evidence here must not be inflated.  The evidence from the RLA landlord surveys in 2017 and 2018, was that, in the first 30 months of the Scheme being in operation, 5-6% landlords in practice discriminated in the manner suggested in this claim.  Even as to likely intent, the evidence from the Joint Council’s own initial survey was that 42% of landlords said that the right to rent requirements had made them less likely to consider someone who does not have a British passport, and 27% said they were reluctant to engage with those with foreign accents or names (see paragraph 30 above).  The other surveys (except that of the Ministry of Housing, where the percentage was significantly lower at 25%: see paragraph 43 above) appear to be broadly in line with those figures.  However, even on the basis of the figures derived from the evidence most advantageous to the Joint Council’s case (and leaving aside any discount for the statistical weaknesses in the data), just over half of private landlords do not discriminate in any way.  Nearly half being guilty of discrimination is, of course, a high proportion – it is shocking – but it means that a potential tenant in the category most discriminated against (no British passport, and no ethically-British attributes) will on average take no longer than twice the time to obtain a tenancy as it would take someone with a British passport.  Whilst, of course, some potential tenants will be unfortunate and take longer than the average time, the evidence cannot support the contention that there are potential tenants who will never obtain private accommodation. </p>

If ineligible for support under the Housing Act, (a) households with dependent children may be eligible for assistance under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 if one or more of the children are “in need” (e.g. if they are homeless), (b) single or childless couples may be entitled to assistance under the Care Act 2014, but they will only be accommodated if their need for care and support cannot be met by the local authority without the authority also providing accommodation and (c) persons who are believed to be the victims of trafficking or modern slavery who have received a reasonable grounds decision will be entitled to secure accommodation lasting until the later of a negative conclusive grounds decision or at least 45 days after any positive conclusive grounds decision.    </p>

However, although that could be cast as a causation argument (and in his judgment my Lord, Davis LJ, considers it as such, and firmly concludes that there is insufficient nexus for the claim to succeed: see paragraphs 158-163 below), that is a point which, in my view, is more appropriately dealt with as a strand of justification (see paragraphs 112 and following below). </p>

It is in the context of that positive development that any discrimination in this case arises.  Furthermore, he submits, since the enactment of the Housing Act 1985, occupation of premises as a person’s “sole or main residence” has been the gateway through which that person has access to various state benefits through various statutory schemes.  By restricting occupation of a residence at all, the Scheme restricts access to this broader range of benefits, which themselves constitute a demonstration of respect for people’s ability to establish and maintain homes, and private and family lives.  For that reason too, he submits, this can be regarded as a positive modality case. </p>

Whilst the positive modality argument was not argued before him, he accepted that the facts of this case came within the ambit of article 8 effectively as a negative modality case, because Strasbourg jurisprudence regards racial discrimination with particular anathema and analysing this case in negative modality terms would not acknowledge any right to a home (see [68]).

Where the state interferes with the process of seeking to obtain a home, in my judgment it must do so without causing discrimination and this either engages article 8 or comes within its ambit.  If the Government’s arguments were correct, a law could be passed which enacted a rule that landlords may only rent to white, British nationals and this would not engage article 8 and therefore not offend against the [ECHR] because article 8 does not give a right to a home, and this would not be a positive modality case.

It has been argued that ‘even the most tenuous links with another provision in the Convention will suffice’ for article 14 to be engaged (see Grosz, Beatson and Duffy, The 1998 Act and the European Convention (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2000) at paragraph C14-10)  Even if this may be seen as going too far, it is indisputable that a wide interpretation has consistently been given by the Court to the term ‘within the ambit’.  Thus, according to the constant case law of the Court, the application of article 14 not only does not presuppose the violation of one of the substantive Convention rights or a direct interference with the exercise of such right, but it does not even require that the discriminatory treatment of which complaint is made falls within the four corners of the individual rights guaranteed by the article. <span style="font-style:italic">This is best illustrated</span> by the fact that article 14 has been held to cover not only the enjoyment of the rights that states are obliged to safeguard under the Convention but also those rights and freedoms that a state has chosen to guarantee, even if in doing so it goes beyond the requirements of the Convention.  This would indicate in my view that the ‘ambit’ of an article for this purpose must be given a significantly wider meaning than the ‘scope’ of the particular rights defined in the article itself.  Thus, in the specific context of article 4 of the Convention, the fact that work or service falling within the definition of ‘normal civic obligations’ in paragraph 3 are expressly excluded from the scope of the right guaranteed by paragraph 2 of that article, in no sense means that they are also excluded from the ambit of the article seen as a whole.”</p>

The court will in this context weigh the benefits of the measure in terms of the aim being promoted against the disbenefits to other interests.  Significant respect may be due to the legislature’s decision, as one aspect of the margin of appreciation, but the hurdle to intervention will not be expressed at the high level of ‘manifest unreasonableness’.

However, even if I am wrong about that, I would conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, Parliament’s policy has been outweighed by its potential for race discrimination.  As I have found, the measures have a disproportionately discriminatory effect and I would assume and hope that those legislators who voted in favour of the Scheme would be aghast to learn of its discriminatory effect as shown by the evidence [before me].  Even if the Scheme had been shown to be efficacious in playing its part in the control of immigration, I would have found that this was significantly outweighed by the discriminatory effect.

For the phraseology of the criterion demonstrates that it is something for the complainant, rather than for the state, to establish.  The rationalisation has to be that, when the state puts forward its reasons for having countenanced the adverse treatment, it establishes justification for it unless the complainant demonstrates that it was manifestly without reasonable foundation.  But reference in this context to any burden, in particular to a burden of proof, is more theoretical than real.  The court will proactively examine whether the foundation is reasonable; and it is fanciful to contemplate its concluding that, although the state had failed to persuade the court that it was reasonable, the claim failed because the complainant had failed to persuade the court that it was manifestly unreasonable.” </p>

Within the UK’s constitutional arrangements, the democratically elected branches of government are in principle better placed than the courts to decide what is in the public interest in such matters.  Those branches of government are in a position to rank and decide among competing claims to public money, which a court adjudicating on a particular claim has neither the information nor the authority to do.  In making such decisions, the legislature and the executive are also able and institutionally designed to take account of and respond to the views, interests and experiences of all citizens and sections of society in a way that courts are not.  Above all, precisely because decisions made by Parliament and the executive on what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds are the product of a political process in which all are able to participate, those decisions carry a democratic legitimacy which the judgment of a court on such an issue does not have.  For such reasons, in judging whether a difference in treatment is justified, it is now firmly established that the courts of this country will likewise respect a choice made by the legislature or executive in a matter of social or economic policy unless it is ‘manifestly without reasonable foundation’.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The manifestly without reasonable foundation criterion, as used domestically, is derived from the Strasbourg court, which, as I have already indicated (paragraph 98 above), generally shies away from formalism.  Properly construed, in my view, the criterion cannot simply apply to some cases where there is an issue of justification in respect of a measure involving an element of social or economic policy separated from other cases by a bright line.  No such line can sensibly be drawn: the degree of social and economic policy involved in any measure will be infinitely variable.  In my view, the criterion simply recognises that, where there is a substantial degree of economic and/or social policy involved in a measure, the degree of deference to the assessment of the democratically-elected or -accountable body that enacts the measure must be accorded great weight because of the wide margin of judgment they have in such matters.  The greater the element of economic and/or social policy involved, the greater the margin of judgment and the greater the deference that should be afforded.  That is, for obvious reasons, particularly so when that body is Parliament.  However, if the measure involves adverse discriminatory effects, that will reduce the margin of judgment and thus the degree of deference.  That will be particularly so where the ground of discrimination concerns a core attribute such as sex or race.  That, in my respectful view, explains Baroness Hale’s observation in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Humphreys</span> (quoted at paragraph 129 above): she could not have meant that, where some element of social or economic policy is concerned, that simply “trumps” any degree of discrimination.   </p>

The Scheme appears to be successful in the sense that there is no evidence that irregular immigrants do now obtain such accommodation.  Ms Kaufmann has led evidence – which Martin Spencer J accepted (see [111]-[123] of his judgment) – that the Scheme is ineffective in persuading irregular immigrants to leave the UK.

Furthermore, she relied upon Freedom of Information requests, reports of the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration and a response of the Secretary of State to the Home Affairs Committee in May 2018 to show that the Secretary of State had no system for evaluating the efficacy of the Scheme.  In the absence of such evidence, she submitted that the Secretary of State could not begin to justify the discrimination caused by the Scheme.   </p>

However, it is clear that, when enacting the provisions, Parliament was aware of the <span style="font-style:italic">risk</span> of discrimination by landlords implementing the Scheme against potential tenants who did not have a British passport and, in particular, those who did not have ethnically British attributes such as name; and was aware of how it was proposed that that risk be managed through section 33 of the 2014 Act (which was introduced to deal with that identified risk) and the Discrimination Code of Practice.  We simply do not know, and cannot properly speculate, as to what might have been the expectation of Parliament as a whole, and its individual members, with regard to the management of that risk.  It certainly cannot be assumed that they considered the risk would be managed so that the discrimination by landlords against potential tenants on grounds of nationality and/or race would not increase as a result of the introduction of the Scheme.  In any event, in respect of the original enactment of the provisions, it is not to the point that the discrimination which has in fact occurred may be greater than that then expected.  If the discrimination is greater than Parliament envisaged when enacting the provisions, about which I express no view, then that is a matter for Parliament (or the Secretary of State) to address. </p>

In short, the best evidence of discrimination which has in fact taken place comes from the RLA surveys, which suggest that, over the first 30 months, 5-6% of landlords discriminated against potential tenants who did not have British passports.  The evidence of likely intent produces a figure of over 40%.  That discrimination will cause delay for some regular immigrants who seek accommodation in the private rental market.  However, they do not necessarily become homeless: the most vulnerable may be entitled to some assistance (e.g.) under the Housing Act 1996. </p>

The courts cannot be heard to entertain such a proposition.  It may be “rational” for a hungry person who has no money to steal bread from a baker’s shop: but he has no valid excuse all the same.  The claimant’s arguments, and the judge’s acceptance of them, in effect involve private landlords being treated (under cover of knowing references to the “real world”), as mere economic and profit-driven automata.  That cannot be entertained.  Ms Kaufmann’s and Mr Bates’ submission that the Scheme “positively incentivises” landlords to discriminate is quite wrong.  The Scheme, taken as a whole, in fact is designed to achieve the opposite.  It is also no answer to say that (some) landlords are only, for fear of penalties, adopting a “risk averse” approach; but, there is no risk if they loyally and conscientiously seek to follow the (quite onerous but, in truth, not particularly onerous) requirements of the Scheme.  Overall, the rational landlord, who is to be deemed to know his legal obligations, is to be taken as being the law-abiding landlord.  Rational people, indeed, acknowledge the fundamental importance to society of adherence to the law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The point can further be tested in this way.  Landlords, or some of them, clearly do not like these provisions, imposing as they do certain time-consuming obligations on them and with the risk of sanction for non-compliance: as evidenced by the enthusiastic endorsement of this claim by the Residential Landlords Association.  But if this claim is right, they will in effect have brought about a declaration as to the incompatibility of the Scheme by reason of their own discriminatory and potentially unlawful conduct in not complying with it.  If that is an acceptable argument, then one wonders about the implications for the requirements imposed upon, for example, employers in comparable situations; or indeed for all those many cases where people dislike the time-consuming requirements of what they choose in this context to see as “red tape”.  That, indeed, is why I view this case as potentially a challenge to the rule of law and is why, in my view, the courts must not countenance it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also this feature – that discrimination is not sanctioned under this Scheme – which in my opinion makes this case obviously different from cases such as <span style="text-decoration:underline">DH</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and <span style="text-decoration:underline">European</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Roma Rights Centre</span> (cited at paragraph 75 and 148(ii) above).  In those cases, the legislative measures in question, when followed, directly and necessarily as a matter of effect if not as a matter of intention brought about the discrimination; and moreover did so through state organs (the state education system and state immigration service respectively).  But that is not so in this case, in either respect.  To the extent that Mr Westgate also suggested, on the latter point, that, in this context, landlords were to be equated with state agents I reject that.  They are not state agents: they are private landlords, contracting as they see fit, provided always they comply with the law.  Besides, even in the formal language of agency this argument fails.  An agent can only lawfully act within his authority: and if (some) landlords are choosing to discriminate in the way suggested then they are not acting within their postulated “authority” at all.  Rather, they are acting directly contrary to it (having regard to the provisions of the Code etc).

The European jurisprudence seems to have developed in such an unstructured and open-ended way that to identify a sure and principled approach, which is then to be applied to the individual facts of each case, seems next to impossible.  It is, of course, possible to view that open-endedness as a thoroughly good thing.  But, as against that, it can lead to uncertainty and inconsistency in outcomes for individual cases.  Moreover, it has long been established that article 14, though having a degree of autonomy, is not in itself a free-standing right; rather, it is designed to be an adjunct to the other substantive rights in the Convention.  But article 14 seems, to me at least, increasingly to be permitted to be acquiring a status and reach which it surely can hardly have been intended to have had at inception: the more so when the words “or other status” are also given a wide meaning, as likewise seems to be the trend.  Certainly my own experience, such as it is, would tend to suggest that article 14 has ceased to retain its (honourable) position of long-stop – it now tends, if anything, to be deployed as an opening bowler. </p>

It is of the stuff of legislation and regulations, for example, to have the effect: this group may have this benefit, that group may not; this group may have this advantage, that group may not; this group need not pay for this service, that group must.

There being no right to a home, and potential homelessness, as such, here not being sufficiently evidenced, a degree of delay and inconvenience in securing a letting where there is initial discrimination – it being borne in mind that the majority of landlords will comply with the Scheme and not discriminate – does not, in my opinion, suffice.
