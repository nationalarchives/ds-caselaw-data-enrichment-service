The site is in the Metropolitan Green Belt, in open countryside outside the settlement boundary. The application for planning permission had been made, in part, under section 73A of the 1990 Act. The development was described in the council’s decision notice as the “[erection] of an occupational [worker’s] dwelling ancillary to use of the land for horticultural and agricultural purposes (retrospective), and erection of a single storey extension to form [an] enlarged bedroom”. The inspector conducted a hearing and undertook a site visit on 20 June 2018. His decision letter is dated </p>

Ms Hook applied to this court for permission to appeal.

Paragraph 79 said that “the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence”. Paragraph 87 said that “… inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances”. The policy in paragraph 88 was that, “[when] considering any planning application, local planning authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green Belt”, and that “‘[very] special circumstances’ will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations”. Paragraph 89 said that “[a] local planning authority should regard the construction of new buildings as inappropriate in [the] Green Belt”, but identified six exceptions. The first exception was “buildings for agriculture and forestry”. That exception re-appeared in identical terms in the corresponding policy in the revised version of the NPPF published in July 2018 (in paragraph 145), and again in the replacement version published in February 2019 (in paragraph 145). </p>

They are broad concepts of planning policy, used in a wide range of circumstances (see the judgment of Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City </span>Council [2012] UKSC 13; [2012] 2 P. &amp; C.R. 9,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>at paragraph 19).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.01in">In dealing with the “threshold” question of whether a proposal is for “inappropriate development” in the Green Belt, and then in deciding whether the proposal is acceptable and ought to be given planning permission, the decision-maker must establish relevant facts and exercise relevant planning judgment. If called upon to review the decision, the court will not be drawn beyond its limited role in a public law challenge (see the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd. v Secretary of State for the Environment </span>[1995] 1 W.L.R. 759, at p.780G-H). The interpretation of planning policy falls ultimately within that role, but the decision-maker’s application of policy will only be reviewed on traditional public law grounds (see the judgment of Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco v Dundee City Council</span>, at paragraphs 18 and 19). As this court has emphasized more than once, excessive legalism must be avoided (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">East Staffordshire Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 893, [2018] P.T.S.R. 88, at paragraph 50). The court will not second-guess the decision-maker’s findings of fact unless some obvious mistake has occurred, nor interfere with the decision-maker’s reasonable exercise of planning judgment. But if an error of law is demonstrated – such as a misinterpretation of relevant policy leading to a failure to exercise a planning judgment required by that policy – its duty is to act. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.01in">The nature of the decision-maker’s task will differ from one kind of development to another. For example, whether a proposal is for “buildings for agriculture and forestry” – the first category of “new buildings” that are not to be regarded as “inappropriate development” under the policy in paragraph 89 of the NPPF – will be largely if not wholly a matter of fact. There is no proviso in that category (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lee Valley</span>, at paragraph 19). By contrast, assessing whether a proposed “[facility] for outdoor sport” – the second category in paragraph 89 – would “preserve the openness of the Green Belt” is largely a matter of planning judgment. The same applies to proposals for “mineral extraction” or “engineering operations” – two categories of “other forms of development” that are potentially “not inappropriate” under the policy in paragraph 90, which are subject to the same proviso. The requisite planning judgment will turn on the particular facts. It is not predetermined by the general statement in paragraph 79 that one of the “essential characteristics” of Green Belts is their “openness” – meaning, in that context, the mere presence of buildings, regardless of any visual impact they might have (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lee Valley</span>, at paragraph 7). In the context of a development control decision, as Sales L.J. observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Turner</span> (at paragraph 14), “[the] word “openness” is open-textured and a number of factors are capable of being relevant when it comes to applying it to the particular facts of a specific case”, and (at paragraph 15) “[the] question of visual impact is implicitly part of the concept of the “openness of the Green Belt” as a matter of the natural meaning of the language used in para. 89 of the NPPF”.  </p>

That application was refused by the council in April 2004, and the subsequent appeal dismissed in April 2005. In September 2004, the council granted retrospective planning permission for the erection of two buildings, to be used as stables and for the storage of hay. In April 2005, Ms Hook applied for planning permission for the erection of a single-storey cabin, to be used as a groom’s quarters, which the council refused in October 2005. In August 2005, she converted a field shelter on the site to a dwelling, and she began living there in September 2005. In February 2009, the dwelling was extended by the addition of a porch.  </p>

The enforcement notices had to be complied with by the end of February 2011, but were not. In fact, Ms Hook carried out further work on the site without planning permission, extending the dwelling-house in October 2013. An injunction requiring compliance with the enforcement notices was granted in October 2014. It required – among other things – the cessation of any residential use by 30 April 2015, and the demolition of the dwelling-house by 30 April 2016. It has not been complied with. </p>

The first reason stated that the council did not consider “the use of the land for the purposes described in [the] application” gave rise to an “essential need for a rural worker to live permanently on the site”; that it had “not been demonstrated that the horticultural business undertaken is financially viable and is or can become a sustainable form of rural development”; and that the proposed development did “not comply with the aims and objectives of [the NPPF] …”. The second reason stated that “[the] proposed development constitutes inappropriate development in the Green Belt”; that, “[in] addition to the by definition harm which results by way of inappropriateness the development erodes the rural character of the site and the wider area, reduces openness and encroaches into the countryside thereby conflicting with one of the purposes of including land in the Green Belt”; and that “[there] are no very special circumstances … to clearly outweigh the identified harm to the Green Belt and accordingly the proposal is contrary to the aims and objectives of the Core Strategy and Development Management Policies 2012 and [the NPPF] 2012”.

Instead I consider the scale of this operation to be comparable to that which a keen amateur gardener could have at their home.

Consequently, the dwelling is a not a building for agriculture. Therefore the development does not fall within this exception to Green Belt policy in paragraph 89 of [the NPPF]. The parties agree that the dwelling does not fall within any other exception. As such I consider that the development is inappropriate in the Green Belt.

Equally, her projections for the coming years continue to show a steady growth in both aspects, but still a reliance on the landscape gardening aspects rather than plant sales.

Thus the suggested condition “became irrelevant”. The inspector was entitled to reject the argument that there could, in future, be a change of use to agricultural use, “as there was no evidence of any such actual or proposed change of use”.

The inspector had found, “primarily by reference to the development of the dwelling which had already occurred”, that it was “not agricultural”; it was “the primary development and … not ancillary to an agricultural or horticultural use”. Though it might be possible for there to be a change of use to agriculture under section 55 of the 1990 Act, he had “rightly found that this was not the development currently before him” (paragraph 11 of the judgment).

He had erred in law in failing to consider the possibility of imposing an agricultural occupancy condition in the form of condition 4, or substantially in that form, to control development as thus described. Such a condition would have been a suitable and effective means of regulating the use of the building. It would have ensured that the building was a “[building] for agriculture” under the policy in paragraph 89 of the NPPF, and therefore not “inappropriate development” in the Green Belt. It was, Mr Bowes submitted, a material consideration – indeed, the “critical” consideration in the appeal. From the inspector’s failure to mention it in his decision letter the court may infer that regard was not had to it (see the speech of Lord Lloyd of Berwick in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v Secretary of State for the Environment</span> [2017] P.T.S.R. 1091, at pp.1095 and 1096).</p>

He submitted that although the inspector had found that the present use of the site was not agricultural, this did not prevent him from considering an agricultural occupancy condition. To suggest that it did was to misunderstand the scope of the power in section 73A to grant planning permission for development “carried out before the date of the application”. Unlike a decision-maker applying the provisions of section 177 of the 1990 Act, an inspector considering a proposal to retain a building under section 73A can lawfully grant planning permission subject to a condition allowing it to be used for a different purpose from its present use. That power, said Mr Bowes, derives either from section 73A(3) or from the combined effect of sections 70(1) and 73A(1).  </p>

Here the permission was for the retention of the building as an agricultural building. Condition 2 effectively imposed a positive requirement to use it for agricultural purposes, and the building had to be removed if it ceased to be so used. It was not the effect of the permission to make the building lawful, no matter what use it might be devoted to. Until it began to be used for agricultural purposes, in my judgment, it remained an unlawful building (and the enforcement notice requiring its removal remained effective); and, if it began to be used, but then ceased to be used, for agricultural purposes, it had to be removed under the second part of condition 2. The building was lawful only if it was used for agricultural purposes and only so long as it was so used.” </p>

He concluded that because the building in that case “was not constructed for the purposes of agriculture, it was inappropriate development”, the inspector was entitled to treat it “not as inappropriate development in the Green Belt but as appropriate development” (paragraph 19). He went on to say that the inspector’s “approach, looking at the building as it was and taking into account the prospect of adaptation, was … entirely appropriate in terms of the policy of PPG2, and it properly reflected the realities of the case before him” (paragraph 25). This would mean, submitted Mr Bowes, that on an application under section 73A it would be impossible for a building not originally constructed for agriculture to be treated as an “agricultural building”, even if an agricultural occupancy condition was imposed.

But the building he was considering, as he found, was not a “[building] for agriculture”.

They are supported by the more specific findings: that the “scale” of Ms Hook’s landscape gardening business was “comparable to that which a keen amateur gardener could have at their home”, that “only a minimal proportion of her income [was] derived from plant sales”, that whilst “this may increase, as suggested in the projected figures, it would remain … a minor part of her business” (paragraph 10), and that the activity involved in keeping two horse stabled at the site, which “she rides for recreation”, amounted to a use that was “fairly small” (paragraph 11). It is also clear that the inspector had well in mind Ms Hook’s intentions for the future. He referred to the evidence on her projections for the landscape gardening business in “the coming years”, in the light of which he still “[did] not consider that there [was] an essential need for [her] to reside permanently on the site to manage this part of the operation” (paragraphs 21 and 22).

Its purpose was to gain planning permission for the dwelling that had been constructed on the site without the required permission.

As he said, accepting the council’s position, “the use of the word ancillary in the description of the development used on the decision [notice] does not presuppose the dwelling is considered ancillary”, and it was therefore “necessary to consider the scale of the use of the land to ascertain whether or not the dwelling is ancillary to that” (paragraph 8 of his decision letter).  </p>

Only then could a condition restricting occupancy to an agricultural worker be regarded as consistent with the principle that a planning condition must fairly and reasonably relate to the development permitted. Had the inspector been satisfied that the building proposed to be retained was in fact, or would become, a “[building] for agriculture”, the suggested condition would have been a relevant matter to consider, because it might have been an appropriate and necessary means of ensuring that the building would remain an agricultural worker’s dwelling.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The need to impose an agricultural occupancy condition did not, therefore, arise. The suggested condition was not a material consideration, let alone – as Mr Bowes submitted – a “main issue” in the appeal. The inspector, though obviously aware of it, did not act unlawfully by omitting to have regard to it in making his decision. He was not required to take into account a condition that was incompatible with the proposal before him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In my view, therefore, the inspector’s approach was both realistic and correct. Given his findings of fact and conclusions in the light of the cases advanced at the hearing, he did not have to consider granting a planning permission that would be effective only upon a future change of use neither proposed nor even in prospect. Had he granted planning permission subject to an agricultural occupancy condition, his decision would have been inconsistent with those findings of fact and conclusions. It would have offended the principle that planning permission ought not to be granted subject to a condition unrelated to the development. And as was conceded by Mr Bowes in his submissions at the hearing, it would also have created the possibility of the building remaining on the site in breach of the condition until the council took the necessary enforcement action. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">This ground alleges a breach of the rules of natural justice on the part of the inspector because, in his decision on costs, he concluded (in paragraph 9), “having found that the building is not agricultural, … it would not be reasonable to change and then restrict the use of the building to agriculture by condition”, without giving Ms Hook the opportunity to produce evidence or make submissions to show the condition was reasonable. This, said Mr Bowes, offends the principles of procedural fairness, which require a party to a planning appeal to know the case it has to meet, and to have a reasonable opportunity to put its own case (see <span style="font-style:italic">Hopkins Developments Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 470; [2014] P.T.S.R. 1145, in particular the judgment of Jackson L.J. at paragraph 62, and the judgment of Beatson L.J. at paragraphs 85 to 90). At the hearing, the condition was not controversial and Ms Hook did not know she had to show it was “reasonable”. This “procedural unfairness” caused her “material prejudice”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">I would reject this argument, for three reasons. First, as I have said, it is normal practice for inspectors determining planning appeals to consider, with the help of the parties, whether conditions should be imposed on any grant of planning permission, and what conditions might be suitable. In this case the inspector had included “Conditions” in his hearing agenda. Ms Hook was represented at the hearing by experienced counsel. And it cannot be said that, at the hearing, she was unaware of the need to make any comment she wanted to make on the suggested agricultural occupancy condition. Secondly, the condition was discussed at the hearing. Ms Hook had a fair opportunity to state her position, and she took that opportunity. Mr Bowes made a clear submission on the condition in his speaking note. And thirdly, when we asked him what else would have been said at the hearing had the inspector made the parties aware that the reasonableness of the condition, or a condition like it, was in question, Mr Bowes pointed to the Government’s advice on the tests for planning conditions in the Planning Practice Guidance. The inspector would have been familiar with that advice. I cannot accept that drawing it to his attention would have made any difference to his decision on Ms Hook’s appeal. </p>

Mr Bowes relied on the wellknown passage in the speech of Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in <span style="font-style:italic">South Bucks District Council v Porter (No. 2)</span> (at paragraph 36): reasons must be “intelligible”, “adequate” and “enable the reader to understand why the matter was decided as it was and what conclusions were reached on the “principal important controversial issues””. On this matter there was, he submitted, room for “genuine … doubt” as to “what has been decided and why” (see the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke Homes Ltd. v Secretary of State for the Environment</span> (1993) 66 P. &amp; C.R. 263, at pp.271 and 272). An agricultural occupancy condition is acceptable in principle (see <span style="font-style:italic">Fawcett Properties Ltd. v Buckinghamshire County Council</span> [1961] A.C. 636), and may be imposed on a retrospective planning permission (see <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte Grimes</span>, at p.319). The council, having suggested the condition, plainly regarded it as reasonable in principle – a practical restriction whose effect would be to ensure that the dwelling on the site could only be ancillary to agricultural use and thus a “[building] for agriculture”, which would not be “inappropriate development” in the Green Belt. The inspector should therefore have considered it. Mr Bowes relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Brightwell v Secretary of State for the Environment</span></p>

Restricting the use of a building by a condition was a measure commonly employed to make development acceptable and compliant with policy. The agricultural occupancy condition suggested here was a typical example. To reject it as “unreasonable” was irrational.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">I cannot accept those submissions. In my view, following from the analysis I have already set out, the premise for them is false. There is no dispute that an agricultural occupancy condition can be acceptable in principle, provided it satisfies the basic legal tests for the validity of a planning condition (see paragraph 33 above). But in this case the possibility of imposing such a condition did not arise, because on the evidence he received and the submissions he heard, the inspector was not satisfied that the present or proposed future use of the building on the site was ancillary to an agricultural use. As he said in paragraph 12 of his decision letter, “the dwelling is the primary development at this site and it is not ancillary to the use of the land” and “[consequently] … is not a building for agriculture”, and, in paragraph 13, “the change of use of land or buildings to agriculture … is not the development before me”.  </p>

It is also distinguishable from <span style="font-style:italic">Brightwell</span>, where the central issue was not whether the dwelling was “ancillary to the use of the land” and consequently a “[building] for agriculture”, but whether the agricultural enterprise relied upon to justify planning permission being granted for a dwelling was a viable enterprise, and, in that context it was relevant to consider whether a “time condition” should be imposed to allow the financial sustainability of the enterprise to be proved.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In my view, therefore, in the circumstances of this case there was no obligation on the inspector to explain in his decision letter why he was not granting planning permission for the proposal before him subject to an agricultural occupancy condition. His findings and conclusions in paragraphs 7 to 13, and in paragraphs 21 to 25, made that unnecessary. The requirement for “intelligible” and “adequate” reasons, explaining sufficiently why Ms Hook’s section 78 appeal was dismissed, and identifying the inspector’s conclusions on the “principal important controversial issues”, was satisfied. On a fair reading of the decision letter itself, here is no room for “genuine doubt” about the basis for the decision. But in his costs decision the inspector also explained why he had disregarded the condition. This he did succinctly, in terms corresponding to the findings and conclusions in the decision letter itself. As he said (in paragraph 9), it “would not be reasonable to change and then restrict the use of the building to agriculture by condition”. That statement, it seems to me, is an obvious corollary of the conclusions on which he based his decision to dismiss the appeal. And it was not irrational. </p>

For all that had been achieved in regularising the planning situation for or against Ms Hook, these events might as well not have happened. Whatever the human situation, she is a planning recidivist. Yet she now claims that it is the council and the inspector who were acting illegally in respect of her fourth planning application. Her claims must be, and have been, fairly considered on their objective merits, but one wonders what purpose is being served by an apparently endless series of applications, decisions and technical appeals whose outcomes are seemingly neither obeyed nor enforced. </p>
