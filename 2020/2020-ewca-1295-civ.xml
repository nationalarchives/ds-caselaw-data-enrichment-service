The appeal turns on a narrow issue, namely the decision by the judge to make no award in respect of the additional capital cost which she found to be required by the Appellant/Claimant so as to fund the purchase of a more expensive house than she would have required uninjured.  The judge did so, concluding that she was bound by the approach set down in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>[1989] QB 878.  A significant cause of that outcome was the current negative discount rate.  The approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>is to award a claimant lost return on capital which must, perforce, be invested in attributable additional house purchase.  Where the stipulated assumed rate of return on damages invested by such a claimant is negative, then there can be no loss of investment. The appeal proceeds on this issue by the permission of the judge herself.   </p>

She was a very active and sports-oriented individual and has made sustained efforts at rehabilitation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first submission was that the Appellant should be awarded the cost of an interestonly mortgage to bridge the difference between the value of the property currently held by the Appellant, which would be sold to fund part of the purchase of the special accommodation required, and the full purchase price of that accommodation.  The Appellant had not adduced any expert evidence to support that proposition.  Before the judge, it was argued by Mr Arney that a basic search of the internet could demonstrate that the current annual interest rate on an interest-only mortgage was 3.8%.  If that were accepted, it was a matter of straightforward mathematics to apply that base percentage to the additional capital required of £900,000 and then to apply the current negative discount rate of 0.75%.  The outcome would be an award in the region of £1.89m.  As the judge observed, that was “more than double the sum which the notional mortgage is intended to fund”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second approach, advanced in the alternative by the Appellant, was that the annual cost of an interest-only mortgage with borrowing of £900,000 should be defrayed by a matching Periodical Payment Order.  That would limit the annual costs to the Appellant’s lifespan, thus matching the need.  However, the judge observed that the Appellant had a normal predicted expectation of life. If she fulfilled her predicted life expectation to 89.1 years, then the result of a Periodical Payments Order in the required annual amount would “well exceed the difference in capital cost between the Claimant’s injured and uninjured accommodation needs”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third approach advanced, Mr Arney’s most favoured, was that the judge should adopt the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>approach but substitute a different rate of return when calculating the multiplicand.  The schedule of loss was calculated on the suggested appropriate rate of 2%, on the basis that that figure was “in line with the interest award on general damages”.  To this the judge observed that: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“No explanation is advanced in the Schedule or in submissions for using 2% as the notional rate of return.  The total damages to be paid if this formula were to be adopted would again be in excess of the difference in value between the capital cost of the uninjured and special accommodation, but only marginally so.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The fourth alternative which was advanced was that there should be an award for damages reflecting the cost of renting special accommodation.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In considering the options advanced by the Appellant, the judge began by noting the decision of William Davis J in <span style="font-style:italic">JR (A protected party by his mother and litigation friend) v Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</span> [2017] EWHC 1245 (QB).  She observed that in that case the court was invited to depart from the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> approach.  Two alternative approaches had been advanced in that case:  firstly, an award of a lump sum reflecting the full difference in value between the property which the claimant would have owned and the accommodation needed as a result of the injuries; secondly, an award reflecting that full difference, but subject to the deduction of the award to be made in the case by way of general damages.  Mrs Justice Lambert observed that the judge in <span style="font-style:italic">JR v Sheffield</span> had expressed no view on the merits of either of those approaches. Noting that he had no expert evidence as to current or projected mortgage interest rates, or evidence of future trends in the net returns from low risk investments, he concluded that he was bound by <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>.  By reference to the negative rate of return on money, he made no award in respect of additional accommodation cost.  In that case too, the judge granted leave to appeal on the point, but the matter never came before this court, since the appeal was compromised shortly before the hearing. </p>

It was wrong as a matter of principle to award a claimant the full, incremental, capital cost of special accommodation, since that would not lead to full restitution but would result in over-compensation.  The overcompensation arose because, at the claimant’s death, his or her estate would benefit from an asset which had enhanced, not diminished, in value.  The problem could not be solved, at the time of <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>, by an award of the predicted cost of a </p>

At the time of <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> in the late 1980s, as the judge noted, mortgage interest rates were running at between 9-10% per annum.  For that reason, not only would there be an additional capital asset as windfall on the death of the claimant, but an immediate cash surplus constituting an “even larger windfall” would be produced. </p>

The Court of Appeal found the answer to the conundrum in the notional cost, or “going rate” of temporarily foregoing the use of the money required to fund the purchase of special accommodation.  Stocker LJ found the “going rate” to be 2% per annum on the basis of the analysis of Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright v British Railways Board</span> [1983] 2AC 773 of the appropriate interest rate to be applied for non-economic loss.  Expert evidence available to the House in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright</span> had demonstrated that the real return from investments which conferred a risk element were, in times of inflation, “no better than 2%”.  Stocker LJ recognised that the interest rate to be applied for non-economic loss may not be thought to be appropriate to economic loss, such as the notional cost of mortgage interest on acquired property; however he reasoned that, where the capital asset in respect of which the cost is incurred consists of house property, the inflation and risk element were secured by the rising value of such a property as bricks and mortar will maintain their value.  Lord Lloyd in <span style="font-style:italic">Wells v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span>, saw no reason to regard the figure of 2% as sacrosanct and, in the light of the expert evidence on the average net return on low risk Index-Linked Government Stock in the conjoined appeals before him increased the figure to 3%, thus bringing it in line with the discount rate to be applied for the calculation of multipliers for future loss.  The figure has been subsequently “kept up to date” by the Lord Chancellor when exercising powers under s 1 of the Damages Act 1996 decreasing to 2.5% in 2001 and still further to -0.75% in March 2017.” </p>

The real point which Mr Arney was making to me, both in the Schedule and in his oral submissions, is that the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> formula is no longer fit for purpose in the modern context of a negative discount rate. It leads to unfairness and a result which is not consistent with the principle of full restitution.  He submits that it could never have been the intention of the Court of Appeal to have devised a formula which resulted in a nil award.  However, I note that the problems, or anomalies, which the application of the formula can produce have been present since 1989: the need to fund the property purchase by scavenging from damages allocated to other losses is intrinsic to the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts</span> formula itself.  As Tomlinson LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Manna v Central University Hospitals NHS</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Foundation Trust </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 12, the “robbing Peter to pay Paul” effect of the formula leads to particularly anomalous (and problematic) results in a number of different contexts: in catastrophic injury/short life cases; in cases in which there has been a discount for contributory negligence or a compromise has been reached; in cases in which damages for care needs are to be met by a Periodical Payments Order thus drastically reducing “surplus” income which might be used to fund a property purchase.  In these situations, as the Court of Appeal observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Manna</span>, the extent of the shortfall between the sum needed to fund the property and that recovered may be so great that the property cannot be purchased. The effect of the negative discount rate is to create a further (albeit larger and more extreme) category of anomaly.   </p>

It cannot be sensibly argued otherwise.  Each alternative formulation advanced by the Claimant in this case would produce, if capitalised, a final figure greater than the loss which the formula is intended to address.  Each formulation would produce the “windfall” which the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts</span> considered to amount to over-compensation.  As I have said, so far as I am concerned, that must be the end of the matter.  In the circumstances, I make no award in respect of the additional costs associated with the purchase of special accommodation. I note, only in passing, that the basis in principle for Mr Arney’s selection of a 2% discount rate remains unexplained.  Further I, for my part, doubt that, if it were to be contended that mortgage interest rates were to be the basis for the loss calculation, it would be sufficient to rely upon the current interest-only mortgage rate: expert evidence on the trajectory of such rates in the future would be required.  Such evidence is not currently deployed by the Claimant.  Further, although Mr Arney’s alternative formulations included a Periodical Payment Order in respect of the annual costs of an interest only mortgage, this was not the course which he advanced as his primary case.  In any event, however, as I have already said, if capitalised even this approach would produce a figure higher than the loss which the Claimant seeks to recover.” </p>

Tomlinson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Manna v Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 12 noted the various scenarios in which the shortfall between the damages awarded and the sum needed to fund the property may be so great that the property could not be purchased.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In preparing for the adjourned appeal, the parties consulted a number of experts. As a result, a number of the options previously advanced were abandoned.  In the report from the Civil Justice Council of 2010 the authors favoured the solution of an interestonly mortgage advance of the additional sum needed for purchase, backed by a periodical payments order [“PPO”].  The mortgage experts instructed for both sides reached agreement that this was not a practical solution.  It was unlikely that a mainstream lender would accept income based on a PPO.  Moreover, interest only mortgages were generally not widely available in the current market and lifetime mortgages were not generally available to younger borrowers.  The developing market in “equity release” lending later in life was noted, but the experts could not predict what later life products would be available in 35 years’ time.  No suitable relevant product existed at the present time, and the experts felt it was unlikely that commercial lenders would be prepared to provide one in cases of long life expectancy.  As the defendant would not retain any interest in the claimant’s property under such an arrangement, it would be for the claimant’s estate to bear the costs of restoring the property for sale at the conclusion of the claimant’s life. It would also follow that if there was any change in the real value of the incremental property purchased over the claimant’s lifetime, the estate would still acquire the windfall (or bear the burden of any decrease).  For those reasons, this proposal was abandoned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The parties explored whether an adjustment to the multiplier/multiplicand applicable to the claimant’s life, whether based on mortgage repayments, interest on mortgage repayments or on rental costs, might be an apt solution. However, in the appellant’s case (and in other cases of long future life) the lifetime multiplier was such that any mortgage-interest-based calculation would lead to an award which exceeded the capital sum of £900,000.  For example, at a typical rate of 3.8%, the interest-only payments on £900,000 equates to annual payments of £34,200.  Applying the established multiplier of 55.02 would give an award £1,881,684.  For the award to be less than £900,000 the multiplicand would need to be around £16,300 and would require a mortgage rate of 1.817%. Such a rate was unachievable.  Hence, this potential solution was abandoned. </p>

In that case the claimant was a young woman badly injured in a traffic accident.  She was living in rented council accommodation with her mother and grandmother.  But for the accident, it was assumed she would not purchase any accommodation.  Out of a significant interim payment she did buy a bungalow for the capital outlay of £12,000.  She had a life expectancy which the judge set at 13 years and she needed intensive personal care.  She appealed against a number of the aspects of her damages award.  As becomes clear from the judgment of Orr LJ, the judge had awarded no discrete element of damages in respect of her accommodation cost.  As summarised by Orr LJ, after dealing with a number of identified elements in the award, the damages included “For the remaining elements of general damages, including loss of amenities and pain and suffering, £19,000”.  The respondent argued this must have included an award for the accommodation purchase cost, albeit in an undifferentiated way. The court rejected that submission.  Rather than remit the matter, this court addressed this head of claim in the appeal, in the following terms: </p>

In my judgment, this argument is well founded, and I do not think it makes any difference for this purpose whether the matter is considered in terms of a loss of income from the capital expended on the bungalow or in terms of annual mortgage interest which would have been payable if capital to buy the bungalow had not been available. The plaintiff is, in my judgment, entitled to be compensated to the extent that this loss of income or notional outlay by way of mortgage interest exceeds what the cost of her accommodation would have been but for the accident. She would also, in my judgment, have been entitled to claim the expenses of a move to a new home imposed by her condition and the expense of any new items of furniture required because of that condition, but there was no evidence before the judge under either of those headings. As to the increased cost of accommodation, if any, it was, as I have said, agreed that we should make the best estimate we could on the available material, and the matter can only be approached on a broad basis. </p>

If she had married, it is in my judgment more likely than not that she would have continued to work, not necessarily continuously, and would have made substantial contributions to the matrimonial home. Taking into account, on the one side, the loss of income arising from the purchase of the bungalow, and, on the other, the expenses she would have been likely to incur apart from the accident, and allowing for tax in the calculation, I would assess the damages under this heading at £3,000, and I would award that sum as additional damages.” </p>

The difference between the proceeds of the family home which had been sold and the purchase price of the required bungalow was £68,500.  As analysed by Stocker LJ in his leading judgment, the judge at first instance had “clearly lumped together the cost of the bungalow plus the cost of its conversion before deducting the value of Hill cottage…” [Page 890F].  The judge had then discounted the sum of £10,000, representing an increase in value brought about by the cost of improvements and then deducted a further element because the property purchased was “much pleasanter than it needed to have been in order to provide adequately for the plaintiff”.  He then expressed himself as “arbitrarily” taking off one third of the product of his computation as representing an element of increased charges. </p>

It seems to us, however, that where the capital asset in respect of which the cost is incurred consists of house property, inflation and risk element are secured by the rising value of such property particularly in desirable residential areas, and thus the rate of 2 per cent. would appear to be more appropriate than that of 7 per cent. or 9.1 per cent., which represents the actual cost of a mortgage loan for such a property. </p>

A tax-free yield of 2 per cent. in risk-free investment would not be a wholly unacceptable one. Mr. McGregor, for the plaintiff, objects that if a rate of 2 per cent is adopted then the multiplier of 16 would be far too low and a substantially higher multiplier should be adopted, resulting in much the same anomaly. For our part we would reject this argument, since the object of the calculation is to avoid leaving in the hands of the plaintiff's estate a capital asset not eroded by the passage of time; damages in such cases are notionally intended to be such as will exhaust the fund contemporaneously with the termination of the plaintiff's life expectancy.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“It is of the nature of a lump sum payment that it may, in respect of future pecuniary loss, prove to be either too little or too much. So far as the multiplier is concerned, the plaintiff may die the next day, or he may live beyond his normal expectation of life. So far as the multiplicand is concerned, the cost of future care may exceed everyone's best estimate. Or a new cure or less expensive form of treatment may be discovered. But these uncertainties do not affect the basic principle. The purpose of the award is to put the plaintiff in the same position, financially, as if he had not been injured. The sum should be calculated as accurately as possible, making just allowance, where this is appropriate, for contingencies. But once the calculation is done, there is no justification for imposing an artificial cap on the multiplier. There is no room for a judicial scaling down. Current awards in the most serious cases may seem high. The present appeals may be taken as examples. But there is no more reason to reduce the awards, if properly calculated, because they seem high than there is to increase the awards because the injuries are very severe.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the course of his speech, Lord Lloyd distinguished between the position of the “ordinary investor” and such plaintiffs as those party to the appeal.  The former could address fluctuations in the value of their investments because they could “wait for long term recovery”.  Injured plaintiffs could not do so because they needed “the income, and a portion of their capital, every year to meet their current cost of care.”  Lord Lloyd therefore concluded that “it does not follow that a prudent investment for the ordinary investor is a prudent investment for the plaintiffs” (page 366H).  It was on that basis that Lord Lloyd altered the previous practice as to the assumption of the rate of return on investments and thus the multiplier which is to be applied.  Essentially, this was a response to changed conditions in the form of the availability of Index Linked Government Securities [“ILGS”].  Lord Lloyd explicitly approved of the decisions below whereby the judges in the three cases, he said, “were right to assume for the purpose of their calculations that the plaintiffs would invest their damages in ILGS” [page 373 C]. </p>

I can see no reason for regarding 2 per cent. as sacrosanct now that the average net return on I.L.G.S. has changed. The current rate is 3 per cent. This therefore is the rate which should now be taken for calculating the cost of additional accommodation. It has two advantages.

Nevertheless, the object of the award of damages for future expenditure is to place the injured party as nearly as possible in the same financial position as he or she would have been in the accident. The aim is to award such a sum of money as will amount to no more, and at the same time no less than the net loss….” [Page 389F/390B]  </p>

The accumulation of precedent and experience in the careful analysis of the nature and effects of particular injuries can go a long way towards establishing levels of award which may be generally recognised and accepted as reasonable in particular circumstances.  If necessary those levels may be open to adjustment or even correction from time to time by those courts which are best qualified to review what must in essence be a factual assessment of the kind sometimes referred to as a jury question.  In relation to future pecuniary losses and expenses the uncertainties in the calculation are at their most severe.  Here particularly means have been devised to minimise the imprecision.  But despite the development of detailed tables and actuarial calculations there will always remain an element of uncertainty in prediction which may only in a rough and ready way satisfy the desire that justice should be done between both parties. The problem of sufficiently providing for the future care of the very severely disabled plaintiff gives rise to particular concern, since any inadequacy of the award in that respect could be particularly serious.” [Page 394D/G] </p>

With great respect to him, I conclude that this argument was misconceived.  The power in the hands of the Lord Chancellor is established by sections 1/A1(3).  In my view, section A1(4) does no more than identify particular grounds upon which the power may be exercised.  In a sense the subsection adds nothing.  Any exercise of the power on any of the bases set out in subsection (4), which predated the amendment of the statute, would have been obviously<span style="font-style:italic"> intra-vires</span> and almost certainly uncontroversial.  In<span style="font-style:italic"> Wells v Wells</span> itself, the House of Lords gave guidance, even though the Lord Chancellor of the day had not exercised any of his powers in this respect.

He stated that the selection of the date of trial date would be “clearly contrary to principle” and would give rise to a “highly undesirable anomaly” (p 815).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">My second reason turns on the nature of the development of practice and guidance in personal injury litigation.  Perhaps more than in any other field of litigation, disputes are resolved by negotiation and settlement. There is the strongest possible need for clear guidance from the courts as to how fairly to approach such negotiations. Both claimants and insurers have a strong interest in predictability, which brings resolution and some containment of costs.  Yet the nature of adjudication of compensation, perhaps most critically future losses, if it is to amount to anything more accurate than the frankly crude approach adopted many years ago, requires close attention to many changing circumstances: changing life expectancy, changing security of and return on investments, changing medical care and modes of personal care, perhaps being only the most obvious. In my view, there is undoubtedly some tension between desirable certainty and predictability on the one hand, and response to changing conditions on the other. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Many of the decisions at an appellate level bearing on the approach to calculating damages are explicitly based on the conditions of the day.  The decision in<span style="font-style:italic"> Wells v Wells</span> was so.  Guidance is given often with an express indication that the guidance is based on changed conditions, and might be altered by future changes, albeit implicitly significant rather than trivial changes.  Where such guidance is given by an appellate court as to how best, in the currently prevailing circumstances, to comply with legal principle (in this instance fair and reasonable compensation but not overcompensation) then it seems to me conceptually correct to recognise that it is guidance, and not an enunciation of legal principle. The practical consequences for litigation will be little different. Litigants and judges at first instance will not depart lightly from such guidance: the costs risks in personal injury litigation represent a formidable discipline.  But there would be a diminished risk that guidance as to practice will long outlive the conditions which gave rise to it. </p>

As Mr Wilson put it, this is fundamentally because “housing does not just provide the owner with somewhere to live.  It also represents a capital asset which can be sold…”.  Mr Wilson points out that what has become termed “the windfall problem” is not confined to an award of lump sum damages to cover such additional capital cost.  He says: “it would be no different if the defendant provided a periodical payment of a more expensive property, or indeed if the defendant provided an interest-free loan…. In all these cases the claimant, as the beneficial owner of the property, would benefit from any additional capital gain that accrued as a result of owning a more expensive house…. The only circumstances where this windfall problem does not arise is when the claimant does not own property.” </p>

The second element is any incremental gain in the value of the additional capital invested in property arising from a real increase in property value. In both cases a windfall only arises when the injured claimant no longer needs to occupy either the property purchased, or a substitute property purchased following a move. Although there will be cases where an injured claimant eventually moves from their own property into hospital or other residential care, it appears to be accepted by the parties that in the great majority of cases of serious injury any windfall will arise only at the claimant’s death. </p>

They agreed that, in order to accommodate the “dual nature of owneroccupied housing” representing both need and asset, economists have developed the concept of the “user cost of housing”. The full “user cost” model consists of:  mortgage interest paid, plus interest foregone on capital used (opportunity cost), plus depreciation and running costs (repairs and maintenance, taxes, insurance, et cetera), minus capital gain (difference between price at beginning and end of period). Where running costs are covered separately, the user cost of housing reduces to the cost of capital minus the expected capital gain. </p>

They agreed, however, it does not allow for the possibility that house prices might rise, or fall, relative to general inflation”.  They also agree that the model does not allow for differences between claimants who can meet their additional capital needs out of savings or a lump sum award, and those who need to borrow to finance their additional accommodation needs.  As we shall see, the need to borrow may arise at very different points, depending upon the particular circumstances of the case.  In the case of this Appellant, even on the figures as presented by the Respondent, the need to borrow will arise late in life but well within her life expectancy, and at a time of likely vulnerability. </p>

Errors are likely to be smaller, they say, when forecasting the difference between two nominal variables than when forecasting them individually, “for example, forecasting changes in real house prices, rather than individually forecasting nominal house prices and the general level of prices in the economy”. </p>

In his original written evidence of December 2019, Mr Wilson for the Respondent suggests that the user cost of housing will be positive at an average of 0.6% over the next 30 years, for a claimant who needs to borrow. For a claimant who can use capital that would otherwise be saved or invested, his forecasts show that the user cost of housing over the next 30 years will be on average negative at -0.9%, provided the opportunity cost of capital (i.e. the lost investment return) is based on the discount rate applicable in this case, namely -0.75%. Mr Wilson goes on to say that the relevant rates can be averaged “for the claimant who can meet some of the cost in one way and some in the other, and this is the most appropriate way to apply my recommended approach”.  He goes on to add that in his view “it is much more likely that house prices will increase in real terms over the next 40 years than that they will fall or stay the same”. </p>

The likely level of interest rates was lower than previously thought.  The forecast annual user cost of housing for a borrower projected over 30 years was altered from 0.65% to 0.37%.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In cross-examination, Dr Llewellyn emphasised the difficulty of accurate forecasting of property prices just now. He made clear that he could now imagine property prices might well not rise.  In the course of the 1950s, British house prices halved in relation to earnings.  He was asked about his own approach as a serving member of the board of the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) and as former head of forecasting at the OECD. It was important to have in mind the distinction between forecasts and projections. Projections were valid as a means of examining the implications of a specific set of assumptions. At the OECD he would generate and engage with projections over perhaps 30 years. Valid forecasting was done over periods of only one or two years.  Dr Llewellyn agreed with the proposition that the prediction that house prices would hold their value was the “safest” prediction, but it was “not safe”. Given the extraordinarily low interest rates, currently at an historic extreme, it was very likely that interest rates will rise, increasing the cost of mortgage borrowing, and thus holding back property prices. </p>

Every forecast assumes that there may be some unknown events or contingencies during the relevant period.  He accepted that in relation to the user cost of housing there could be big variations over five-year periods.  Although such fluctuations could be averaged out if taken over a long-term view, liquidity mattered more for owner occupiers, and such fluctuations represented a bigger risk at a given particular point in time.  He accepted that forecasts did not always follow the past.  Even the Office of National Statistics [ONS] accepted that there was a great debate about forecasting inflation: everyone recognised this was a difficult area.

Although it may be the safest prediction, I accept from Dr Llewellyn’s evidence that it is no longer a “safe prediction” that property prices will rise or even hold their value over the ensuing decades.  We are not in the same era as the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas, </span>where the experts agreed that property prices would rise to keep pace with inflation.  I accept that the “user cost of housing” is a valid economic tool for historical analysis, taking into account as it does the gain in capital value normally only realised on death.  It is a separate question whether the user cost of housing is an appropriate yardstick for full, fair and reasonable compensation to an injured claimant during life.  Even as an academic approach, the user cost of housing as a predictive tool in relation to an individual appears to me to have a high degree of uncertainty, perhaps particularly starting from such a turbulent economic and financial climate as obtains in mid-2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In respect of the results of her calculations, Ms Angell highlights a number of features. As will perhaps be obvious, the age at which the Appellant is expected to require additional funds is affected by the degree to which there is a need to invest compensation awarded under other heads in the initial property purchase.  Secondly, again based on the assumptions identified, where borrowing late in life is obtained on an “interest only” basis, Ms Angell predicts “no scenarios where the additional value of the property is insufficient to allow the claimant to borrow enough funds to meet the claimant’s expenses. As a result, the “additional compensation payment” in the table… is always zero for the interest only basis.”  By contrast, if it proved to be the case that an equity release product was indeed available to the appellant at the age contemplated, but not on an “interest only” basis, or alternatively that she was unable to afford to defray any interest annually rather than to allow interest to roll up, then Ms Angell’s evidence is that there would need to be a further compensatory award, as she terms it </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There were significant areas of disagreement between Mr Daykin and Ms Angell on this approach.  Apart from the disagreement as to the appropriate nominal discount rate, Mr Daykin emphasised that he regarded “the assumption of a fixed rate of growth of house prices at 3.2% a year for 75 years regardless of market yields as being entirely speculative”.  Mr Daykin agreed with Dr Llewellyn on that point, stating his preference for a market valuation of the reversionary interest, or if need be a simulation of a market valuation. He also considered it “inappropriate to assume that the reversionary interest of the defendant builds up in full, from the time of the trial”. </p>

Like Mr Wilson, she introduced alternative economic assumptions.  She now took the predicted house price inflation at 2.96% per annum, and assumed a future inflation rate for all heads of loss at the same rate, 2.96% per annum.  She took the Ogden discount rate at -0.75% per annum and the “risk-free investment return/nominal discount rate” at 2.1878% per annum. On that basis, she revised her table calculating the effects of an equity release approach as follows: </p>

Looking at future investment returns, she accepted that the method involved projecting very many years into the future.  There were real uncertainties about the assumptions she had made.  She accepted in particular that if there was any doubt or variation in the expected or assumed growth in house prices, then her calculations as to the value of the reversionary interest or what price it might fetch in any existing market fell away. She also accepted, as was obvious, that on her model the requirement for the instigation of some form of equity release, driven by exhausted available funds, arose at a time when the Appellant would be very much older and likely to be at a vulnerable stage in her life. </p>

He noted the revision to -0.25% on 15 July, following the commencement of the Civil Liability Act 2018.  The altered basis of approach in that legislation was a move from the assumption of risk-free investment in a portfolio of index linked gilts to an assumption of investment in a lower risk portfolio.

The principles include the proposition that the capital cost of “upgrading accommodation should actually ensure that the claimant has the funds to purchase the more valuable property which the court has determined will meet his needs”.  Mr Daykin’s third principle he expresses as follows: “the third principle which should in my view be considered as fundamental is that the claimant should <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> be required to use compensation received for other heads of damage in order to finance necessary improvements to their property”.   Mr Daykin’s fourth principle is that the method and implementation of compensation “should not depend on the financial position of the claimant before or after the accident or and whether they already own a property with or without a mortgage”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">3.6 A sixth and significant principle is that, where the method adopted involves a third party, such as mortgage lender, purchaser of reversionary interest or life insurer, the relevant market should be sufficiently deep and liquid to avoid excessive frictional costs and the possibility that the market could operate in a biased fashion against either the claimant or the defendant. </p>

A claimant cannot be penalised in the measure of damages because they happen to have other personal resources.  The approach laid down in<span style="font-style:italic"> Roberts v Johnstone</span> would not do so and I do not understand the Respondent to argue to the contrary.  The sixth principle requires a little more consideration.  It certainly is an apt observation that, if one is using a market model to value an interest, such as a reversionary interest in property many years hence, if that market is not deep or liquid to a sufficient degree then it may indeed operate in an inefficient way, producing effects which may be regarded as “biased”.  Jumping ahead somewhat, this stricture is relevant when we come to consider the restricted market in actual sales of reversionary interests. It must equally be relevant to an approach to compensation which relies on third parties to advance monies 30 or 40 years hence, and where there can be no evidence today of what market will obtain then.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The seventh principle too is of interest.  The essence of this proposition is that the avoidance of overcompensation is not of equal importance to what Mr Daykin identifies as the primary aim of affording an injured claimant fair and reasonable compensation.  The implication is that the avoidance of a potential windfall to the estate of the claimant, representing as it must a potential detriment to a defendant (in reality to an insurer) is of secondary importance.  So far as I am aware, such a ranking of objectives as a matter of the policy of the law has never been articulated in authority in quite those terms, although that implication may be drawn from some of the authorities.  Rather it has been assumed that both objectives may be achieved.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The principal points to be derived from Mr Daykin’s original report can be summarised as follows.  Acknowledging the existence now of equity release products for those above the age of 55, and the newer product described as a “retirement income only mortgage”, Mr Daykin comments that it is highly uncertain what the market may provide very many years hence, when the Respondent’s model anticipates the Appellant’s need to release funds from equity will arise. This echoes the agreed position of the mortgage experts instructed, but not called to give live evidence. In the course of his cross-examination, Mr Daykin summarised his view of the cash flow model: he described it as a hypothetical calculation, based on a very large number of assumptions and modelling hypotheses. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He had two further specific points bearing on the cash flow model: in his view the forced investment of a large proportion of the damages “in a single property which has no return from rental income would be unacceptable as a component of a low risk investment portfolio because of the concentration of risk and lack of diversification”.  In other words, any forced investment of a large proportion of damages, in the view of Mr Daykin, conflicts with the low risk investment approach underpinning the 2018 legislation, and by implication even more so, conflicts with the “no risk” approach which underpinned the -0.75% discount rate obtaining at the time of the trial in this case.  As Mr Daykin put it in cross-examination, one cannot constrain the value of the portfolio without affecting the discount rate.  The obligation to make such an investment “would…require the discount rate assumption to be revisited to allow for very low effective return on that part of the compensation for 35 years or more, which would significantly increase the calculated amount of compensation required.” </p>

Mr Cropper considered the impact of the traditional approach and the paradigm cases. He noted that paradigms 1 and 2 involve changing additional capital need arising during the future. Some of the capital needs would be discounted for early receipt.  In his report, he accepted that even a capital award without deductions in such circumstances might well mean that the claimant had to draw on damages awarded under other heads than the future cost of house purchase.  If a capital award of damages is reduced to reflect the future value of a reversionary interest in the incremental cost of housing, then that would apply in every case.  But, in essence, Mr Cropper emphasises that such reduction would be much more likely to be affordable. </p>

He was concerned that if the full capital is not available to a claimant and they were advised of the future prospect of having to raise finance, they might often be driven to compromise on the proper level of purchase in the first place.  There might also be pressure, as the point of exhaustion of funds approached, to sell and downsize quickly, particularly in the face of an unknown market in equity release type arrangements.  The “cash flow model” was dependent on the ability to release capital. In the case under appeal there was simply no evidence of a mechanism to release such capital when this appellant was nearly 80 years of age. </p>

The assumption underlying the approach is that the claimant will be able to fund the capital acquisition out of the sums awarded under rubrics other than accommodation. But in modern times residential property prices have increased rapidly while general awards for pain, suffering and loss of amenity have remained at their traditional levels. Whilst Peter is no doubt robbed to pay Paul, it must often be the case that the accommodation assessed by the court as suitable is simply not purchased. A further problem confronts the claimant with immediate and pressing needs but a relatively short life expectancy. The adoption of the appropriate multiplier in his case, when allied to the 2.5% notional return upon investment, will lead to a relatively modest award and a large shortfall between it and the cost of acquiring the property which is acknowledged to be required to meet the claimant’s needs during his admittedly short life expectancy…. </p>

In my view, it cannot be regarded as full, fair or reasonable compensation to award nil damages in respect of a large established need, on the basis that, if all the relevant predictions hold good over many decades to come, there will arise a windfall to a claimant’s estate.  Nor is it fair or reasonable compensation to follow the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>approach on the basis that if all the same predictions hold good, there will in addition be in existence a suitable market to enable a claimant, by then elderly or aged, to release equity at a reasonable cost and without unacceptable disruption. </p>

In most cases this will prevent any return on the investment being realised during the claimant’s lifetime, and therefore would logically call for a consequential revision of the presumed return on the remainder of the award. As we have seen from the evidence of Ms Angell, even on her assumed figures, there may well arise a need for additional compensation. As her figures in tables 7.3 and 7.2-E1 demonstrate, at least where the claimant is unable to defray interest payments along the way, these figures are considerable. [112,117]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the avoidance of doubt, there is in my view no proper general basis for requiring a claimant to invest damages awarded under a discrete head (such as future loss of earnings) in the purchase of property, whether the additional cost of property derived from the injury or the property likely to have been acquired otherwise.  Once that is accepted, then there is no basis for a deduction from the overall award to reflect mortgage costs which are avoided if a claimant chooses to invest damages in property. Damages under other heads, such as lost earnings, are fully discounted for early receipt, reflecting the assumed rate of return on investment applying at the time.  There is no case for further deduction.   It should also be noted that the suggestion of such deduction is logically unconnected with the principal question arising in this case.  If that suggestion were correct, it would arise even in cases where no additional property derived from the injury needed to be acquired.

The principle that it is for the claimant to decide how to invest damages is important not merely as a general matter of the autonomy of the individual.  The prudent claimant will wish to build and maintain a reserve of capital against the uncontrollable risks and eventualities of the future. Such a cautious, one might say sagacious, approach is rendered very much more difficult under these circumstances.  As the Respondent’s own “cash flow” analysis demonstrates in the instant case, the<span style="font-style:italic"> Roberts v Johnstone</span> award (or non-award) means that the Appellant may well exhaust the funds awarded to provide for her needs well within her expected life, setting aside any question of provision for living longer, as of course she very well may do. </p>

But to withhold all damages for the purpose of avoiding an eventual windfall seems to me to put a secondary principle before a primary principle: to put the cart before the horse.  It is a valid comment that the Respondent’s approach taken to its logical conclusion, would result in not merely no award but a demand for a deduction from the claimant’s damages awarded under other heads, to reflect the full value of the windfall to the estate which they predict. Of course, the Respondent (no doubt wisely) has not argued to that end, but that does not alter the end point of the logic which they have advanced to support a nil award. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is relevant that it will be rare for the windfall to arise other than at a claimant’s death.  The Respondent has submitted that a windfall might arise on the sale of the property, and the variety of circumstances which arise in such cases means that there will be some occasions when that is so.  But as I have said, in the great majority of cases, the claimant’s needs for accommodation derived from the injury will remain.  If they do move, there will normally be little reason to think that subsequently purchased property will lack the requirements which led to the incremental purchase cost in the first place.  For example, if for family reasons they ‘downsize’ a property, there is likely to remain an incremental requirement above that which would otherwise persist, and where that is so, capital released may properly be regarded as capital released from the “otherwise” house, which had or would have been acquired if the claimant were uninjured.  For the most part, therefore, any windfall should be regarded as likely to arise only after a claimant’s death.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is also an asymmetry arising from the current approach. The Claimant’s needs are assessed now, and assessed for a property purchase which will arise presently or in the near future.  In this case it has of course already arisen.  There is a currency to the valuation or quantification of that need.   Following the current dispensation, the windfall is not assessed now. The whole of the lump sum award which would otherwise be awarded is withheld, to avoid the risk or chance of a windfall.  That would be logical if an alternative way could be devised of funding a claimant’s need on a continuing basis, rather than by a lump sum award.  Many of those who have been critical of <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone </span>have advocated such a solution in one form or another: by funding the payment of rent, by periodical payments funding a loan or a mortgage, by continuing shared ownership. As I have said, at an earlier stage of this litigation, such solutions were thought to be the answer. All have fallen by the wayside.   Therefore, the question is simplified.  This Appellant showed at trial she has a need for £900,000 which can only be awarded as a lump sum. Is that to be withheld in total because of a potential capital windfall, very probably to her estate after her death, which will not be valued until then? My answer is no.  Such an outcome does not represent fair or reasonable compensation. </p>

The Respondent agrees that if the <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> approach is set aside, then the ‘cash-flow’ analysis which they advance as an approach to valuing the reversionary interest is not a practical means of determining the proper level of compensation in individual cases.  Such an approach would require detailed expert actuarial evidence on each side.  That evidence could only be crystallised once the capital cost difference between the “un-injured” house and the “injured” house had been agreed or established by the court. The “cash-flow” model is advanced as relevant to the level of discount to be applied generally. It is agreed that the proper approach is to establish as a capital sum what award is required to fund the purchase of the house required, and then to establish a practicable approach to the calculation of a single sum to be deducted, representing the value of  a reversionary interest in the windfall.  In reality, this comes down to the question of what discount rate should be used for the calculation.  </p>

Otherwise, trust assets may consist of income generating assets such as stocks, shares and residential and commercial property.  Typically, it will be a widow who is the life tenant and typically the children of the family hold the reversionary interests and are the “remaindermen”. </p>

Mr Watson comments that as a group such investors “are also attracted to buying assets at a discount (i.e. at less than their face value), albeit that they have to wait until they have access to that asset.” Mr Watson’s understanding is that a vendor selling a reversionary interest in a trust is not liable for any tax on the proceeds of the sale, nor is the investor purchasing a reversionary interest liable to tax on the profit made on the investment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Watson’s own approach to the “fair and reasonable” valuation is to base his calculations on the yield of the trust assets, net of basic rate tax.  The logic can be expressed as follows: if the beneficiaries take their respective share of the trust assets and reinvest that share in assets with the same yield, then if the life tenant dies exactly at the end of their current life expectancy, the beneficiaries will replicate what they would otherwise have received from the trust.  In the case of an income beneficiary (who would have received income from the trust assets) Mr Watson assesses that by combining the investment income with progressive disinvestment of capital, he is able to replicate the income which would have been received from the trust during the life of the trust.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Similarly, in the case of a reversionary beneficiary, they would have accumulated capital equal to that which they would have received from the trust. When a life tenant occupies the trust property, there is clearly no income from which to determine the yield.  In such cases, Mr Watson’s approach would be to use a yield based on the open market rent which the property could achieve on letting.  In his view that most closely reflects the income which the property asset could generate, and is some objective measure of the benefit of the asset to the life tenant.  Although there is no actual income, merely a notional income, he would use a yield net of basic rate tax.  That means that the resultant split between the beneficiaries is the same as in the case of a trust which has the same actual net yield. He observed that this approach might be said to undervalue the life tenant’s interest, since they are in effect benefiting from not paying the gross rent.  However, the counterargument is that to do otherwise would be to disadvantage the remainderman: why should the remainderman receive less than they would if the trust was income producing?  A key feature of the approach which he uses is that on the “fair and reasonable” basis of valuation, the sum of the different interests do add up to the value of the trust’s assets: in other words, there is no marriage value to be discounted. </p>

The market value of a reversionary interest represents the current value of a long-term, and uncertain-term, investment, where the “marriage value” is postponed for the life of the trust (or in a case such as ours, the life of the injured claimant).  The purchaser of the reversionary interest in part of a residential property will in the end benefit from the “marriage value” of the assets, or rather that part of the marriage value referable to the investor’s proportion of the overall value of the property.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">It is instructive to look briefly at the rather different impact of these valuations in paradigm case 3, involving a much shorter life expectancy. It is not surprising that in such a case the reversionary interest is much greater, whichever discount rate is adopted. In such a case the economists’ evidence would also suggest there is a greater risk of the asset being realised perforce during a downturn in property prices.  However, normally the risk of investment in such a case would appear to be lower, because of the much earlier return. This illustration is not close to the facts of the instant appeal.  As I have noted above, we know from the Government Actuary that the average span of a personal injury claim is around 43 years of future life, and so paradigm 3 represents a case far from the average. It may be that different considerations and arguments could be applied to that category of case. I make no further comment on that and should not be understood to express a view on it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">In Mr Robinson’s approach a key point is that the sum of the values of the two parts of the trust must equal the current value of the assets in the trust, in this instance the house.  That is derived from the context in which he works as he says: “this is because the house is about to be sold, or may already have been sold, and the payments to the parties is to be made out of this known sum.”  Mr Robinson values the life interest by reference to the income generated by the trust sum, or the notional rent which could be charged in respect of property.  He illustrates his approach graphically by suggesting that “a life interest in a safe full of gold bars should be worthless, as no income is generated, and the remaindermen should receive the entire amount.”  His calculation proceeds through the following steps.  He determines the assets held “for this life interest”.  He determines that the asset allocation should give a fair balance between income and capital growth.  He calculates the assumed future return that the assets will provide, that is to say the discount rate in the calculation and he then divides the return into income, or notional rent, for the life tenant and capital growth for the remaindermen.  The present value of the assets is made up of the present value of their future income up to any given date, plus the present value of the market price of the assets at that date.  He then calculates the life interest by discounting the assumed income payments back to the present using the assumed discount rate, weighting each payment by the probability that the life tenant is alive at that date less this life interest.  Then, as a check, Mr Robinson calculates the reversionary interest by discounting the assumed market value of the assets at each future year, weighting those amounts by the probability that the life tenant dies in that year. The value of the life interest is then produced by the market price less this reversionary interest. </p>

As he says, that is because “by the time I am being asked to apportion the trust, the intention is to sell the house and spend the proceeds in other ways.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Robinson thus has to make explicit assumptions about the notional future return on the assets. In his report he describes how, in his own calculations, he assumes a balanced portfolio of 50% “protection assets” and 50% “income-producing assets such as equities, as representing a fair approach to both sides.” He then assumes that income in excess of inflation is allocated to the life tenant, with the rest of the income being used to ensure the capital value of the assets is preserved in real terms for the remaindermen. To make such assumptions good with figures, Mr Robinson takes the average of the Net Dividend Yield on the FTSE All-Share Index of UK equities, which for April 2018 was 3.85%. By contrast the yield on the FTSE Over 15-year IndexLinked Gilt index was -1.64%. Mr Robinson averages those two yields producing 1.1% per annum and suggests that would be appropriate to use in a traditional life interest case. As at February 2020, he suggests that the discount rate calculated in the same manner using up-to-date market factors would coincidentally be 1.1%. Applying that approach to the £900,000 arising in this case he would value the reversionary interest at £552,000 and therefore the life interest at £348,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">As an alternative approach, Mr Robinson considered using a discount rate reflecting a rental yield.  Accepting that he has no expertise in the rental yield on such a property as the one in question here, Mr Robinson performed Internet searches and has assumed a gross rental yield of 3/3.5% on “high-quality London property”.  In relation to costs, again sensibly disclaiming expertise, Mr Robinson has turned to the Government Actuary estimates and has assumed 0.75% per annum of cost is a prudent estimate.  He has assumed basic rate tax of 20% payable on the income received.  The result of his calculations produces a discount rate of 1.8 to 2.2% per annum.  On this basis he calculates the life interest in this case would be worth between £491,000 and £553,000. As a consequence, the reversionary interest would be worth between £347,000 and £409,000. </p>

The marriage value only arises when the interests are combined. But the investor in the reversionary interest purchases entitlement to a share of the marriage value, which is not reserved to the claimant. The reversionary interest will be discounted for early receipt but not on that ground. The appropriate way forward was to support a clean break solution in the course of making a lump sum award.  It was important to have a guideline rate to the discount so as to avoid extended argument. It would be desirable to leave some degree of flexibility so that judges can, if appropriate, respond to changes in the market or particular or striking circumstances in a given case. The guideline rate should not be a permanent straitjacket. What was needed was an endorsement of a methodology, a tool which could be adjusted for particular circumstances if need be.

However, I have no doubt that a market approach must in principle be the correct way to value a reversionary interest.  As I have already noted, the market value of a reversionary interest in this case, and the majority of personal injury cases, represents the current value of a long-term, and uncertain-term, investment.  The “fair and reasonable” approach, whatever the methodology or detail incorporated by the actuary into the process, is designed to fulfil a different function:  the advice is aimed at the early dissolution of the trust and the distribution of the assets.   The process is designed to balance the interests of the parties and, as we have seen, all sorts of considerations, often distant from the circumstances of a personal injury claimant, are brought into play.  Further, it is clear from the evidence of both Mr Watson and Mr Robinson that in the great number of cases they were unaware of what the parties in receipt of their advice as to fair and reasonable valuation actually did with their advice.  By contrast, it seems to me rather obvious that, since the central problem is the current value of a future interest in property, the best measure of the value is what people will pay to acquire it.  If there was evidence of an ample market in such interests, then the conclusion could rest there. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also cautious in another way. It will be recalled that Mr Watson accepted that most of the existing sales of reversionary interests concerned life tenants who were older than this Appellant, and therefore shorter periods were anticipated before the reversionary interest matures.  It was his view that the expected annual return on investment did not alter by reference to the length of the anticipated life tenancy, although of course he accepted that the valuation itself was critically affected by that.  Intuitively, and contrary to Mr Watson’s evidence, one would have thought that the increased uncertainties associated with a longer period before maturity, such as will arise in many of this category of case, might affect not merely the multiplier, but the expectation of return per annum, thus increasing the discount rate desired by investors. If the intuitive position proved to be correct, it would render yet more cautious my decision, doing the best that I can, that a discount rate of 5% is appropriate. </p>

Claimants who have sustained a significant limitation of their damages by reference to the “windfall”, may seek to recoup that shortfall by selling the reversion.  That is perhaps more likely to arise in cases of shorter life expectancy, where the valuation of the reversion will, by definition, be larger, and the reduction in damages greater.  It may well be that the development of an expanded market will over time give a better evidence base from which a revision of the discount rate may be considered. <span style="font-weight:bold">Summary of Conclusions</span></p>

At the core of the determination of this court is the principle of law that a claimant is entitled to full and fair compensation for injury sustained as a result of the defendant’s tort.  The principle provides the legal basis for an individual’s right to claim and to be awarded damages, the purpose of which is to place that claimant, as far as is reasonably possible, in the position he or she would have been absent the injury.  It does not entitle the claimant to be compensated for more than the loss which has been sustained as a result of the defendant’s tort.   </p>

In my judgment, this proposed course undermines the principle of full and fair compensation.

That approach may have been vulnerable to criticism from the start, and criticisms have been made for many years, as Irwin LJ notes at paras. 135-137 of his judgment.  It may be (though I am not sure) that those initial criticisms could have been answered by saying that no general approach can produce perfect justice in every case – that it was “practical, if imperfect”, as Lambert J put it when granting permission to appeal (see para. 20 above).  But I do not think that such an answer is sustainable in the circumstances now prevailing where the application of the negative discount rate leads to a nil award in respect of a real and immediate loss which the Appellant had suffered.  I therefore entirely agree with Irwin LJ’s conclusion at para. 140 of his judgment. </p>

This is not entirely straightforward, but like Irwin LJ I have come to the conclusion that it does not.  At para. 20 of their judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Knauer v Ministry of Justice</span>, quoted at para. 74 above, Lord Neuberger and Lady Hale recognise a distinction – specifically in the field of the calculation of damages for personal injury – between “a matter of legal principle” and “judicial guidance”.  They do not elaborate on the nature of that distinction, but the essential question must be whether the court in question intended the relevant element in its decision to be applicable in all circumstances (the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Cookson v Knowles</span> about the date as at which the multiplier should be applied, which is what <span style="font-style:italic">Knauer</span> was concerned with, is a good example) or to be capable of being revisited if circumstances changed.  I regard the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> as being of the latter kind.  At the risk of simply repeating what Irwin LJ says at para. 79 of his judgment, it is particularly common in this field for the approach to important elements in the calculation of compensation to have to be reconsidered by the courts from time to time in the light of changing economic circumstances: the most obvious example is the way in which they responded, in a series of decisions, to the very high inflation of the 1970s.  In my view the nature of the issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>, and the rationale for the proposed solution, are such that the court must be taken to have understood that that solution was dependent on the broad economic conditions on the basis of which it made its decision continuing to obtain.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The question then is what different approach should be taken to assessing compensation for a loss of the kind with which we are here concerned.  On the face of it the most straightforward approach would be simply to award the claimant the full amount of the cost of the additional accommodation attributable to the injury (“the additional element”).  But of course that fails to take into account the fact that at the point where the claimant ceases to need the additional element (typically, though not necessarily, when they die) they or their estate will continue to benefit from its capital value and to that extent will be over-compensated – or, to use a term which is convenient if not wholly apt, receive a windfall.  If there is a fair and workable means of avoiding that windfall it should be adopted.  As appears from paras. 8-11 and 33-35 of Irwin LJ’s judgment, various ways of addressing the problem which might seem superficially attractive have proved flawed or unworkable on closer examination.  The only workable candidate now in play, at least in a case of the present kind where there is a long-term need for the additional element, is the “value of the reversion” approach, in which the award is reduced by the amount of the present value of a notional right to receive the windfall amount at the assumed date of the claimant’s death.  I agree with Irwin LJ that this is in principle an appropriate way of avoiding over-compensation, at least in a case of the present kind where the claimant has a long life expectancy.  There are, however, two aspects of it which I have not found straightforward. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first is that the deduction of the value of the notional reversion means that the claimant does not receive the full cost of the additional element in their accommodation at the time when it is actually required.  The cash is needed (typically) at the date of the assessment (or indeed may already have been spent, usually with the benefit of an interim payment); and the benefit of enjoying an absolute right to the property instead of merely a life interest is of no use since, as is now common ground, there is no workable means of realising that benefit.   The only way that claimants will be able to fund the shortfall attributable to the deduction is thus either (untypically) from their own resources or (more likely) from the amount awarded in respect of other heads of damage.  Is it not wrong in principle that a claimant should be compelled to invest such resources or damages in their property rather than being free to spend them as they choose, particularly if the pots that have to be raided for this purpose include awards intended to fund future expenditure?  If it is, a claimant should be awarded the full amount needed to fund the additional element in their accommodation at the time when the payment has to be made, and if there is indeed no other means of avoiding overcompensation that will have to be accepted as a necessary consequence of the more important principle of avoiding under-compensation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">That point has given me some pause.  But I have come to the conclusion that it represents too rigid an approach.  The piecemeal development of law and practice in this field makes it very difficult to be a purist; a strong element of pragmatism and practical justice is required.  An award of damages for personal injury contains a number of elements of different characters.  The award for pain, suffering and loss of amenity does not represent pecuniary loss at all.  The award for pecuniary loss comprises both loss of earnings and compensation for expenditure necessitated by the injury.  As regards the latter, the modern process of assessing the elements in the award systematically and separately under each head of loss is a valuable discipline, but it should not mislead us into thinking that the end result is anything but a best estimate or that in the real world claimants will spend the sums awarded precisely in accordance with the assumptions on which they are assessed; and of course, as Lambert J points out at para. 136 of her judgment (quoted by Irwin LJ at para. 18), that is not even possible where there is a deduction for contributory negligence or the parties reach a compromise.  In that context, I do not think that it is unacceptable in principle that, in order to avoid over-compensation, claimants should have to use part of the sum assessed under other heads to fund (in cash-flow terms) the additional element in their accommodation needs.  And in fact Mr Sweeting QC only advanced the contrary submission in a highly qualified form, describing it as “not quite a fallback”.  His position was that if there was no viable mechanism which provided the Appellant with some compensation for her accommodation loss while avoiding a windfall – so that the choice was between her receiving nothing and her receiving the full cost of the additional element – then the Court must take the latter option.  He did indeed point out that the scope for “robbing Peter to pay Paul” (Tomlinson LJ’s phrase from <span style="font-style:italic">Manna</span>) had become more limited in recent years as the level of awards in respect of accommodation had risen much faster (as a result of increases in property prices) than the level of awards for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, and many elements in future loss were covered by periodical payments; but that is a different kind of point.         </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add that I am not sure that it would even be open to us as a matter of authority to hold that robbing Peter to pay Paul (in that sense) is wrong in principle.  As Lambert J points out in the passage already referred to, a degree of “scavenging from damages allocated to other losses” was inherent in <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span> from the start.  (The same is true of <span style="font-style:italic">George v Pinnock</span>.)  Although we are holding that we are free to depart from <span style="font-style:italic">Roberts v Johnstone</span>, that is because of the changes in economic conditions since it was decided, which mean that a claimant would now receive no award whatsoever in respect of their accommodation needs: it is debatable whether that justifies us in going behind the Court’s assumption, which was necessary to its reasoning, that it was acceptable for the plaintiff to have to fund the capital cost of the accommodation out of other elements in the damages.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Having said all that, I must emphasise that I am concerned only with a case of the present kind, where the claimant has a long life expectancy.  In such a case the application of a discount rate of 5% (which, to anticipate, I agree is the correct rate) will mean that the shortfall between the cost of the additional element and the amount awarded will typically be comparatively small and, as Irwin LJ puts it at para. 185, the gap between the need and the damages following deduction of the present value of reversionary interest should be capable of being bridged without creating substantial difficulties for the claimant.  The position will be different in short life-expectancy cases, of the kind illustrated by paradigm 3.  As Irwin LJ says at paras. 170 and 209, these may require a different approach. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point which I have not found entirely easy is that considered by Irwin LJ at para. 146.  There must always be a possibility that the claimant’s need for the additional element in their accommodation will come to an end, or the cost of it be reduced, at a date significantly earlier than their death – for example, if they move to a cheaper property later in life or live their last years in a nursing home or with a relative.  It is true that some additional costs attributable to the injury may continue under the new arrangement, but not always and certainly not necessarily to the same degree.  In such a case there would be a release of capital at that point, and a valuation on the basis that the notional reversion falls in only at the date of death will result in over-compensation.  Irwin LJ acknowledges that possibility, but says that it will occur only rarely.  I am not sure that I agree about that.  However, I would still agree with him that the reversion should be valued at the predicted date of death (except perhaps in unusual circumstances where the probability of a substantially earlier release of capital was high).  The scenarios in which a pre-death release of capital may occur are simply too </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">variable and too uncertain for an appropriate adjustment to be quantified in any way that was not mere guesswork; and the adjustment would not in any event be substantial in the context of the overall valuation given that it would be intended to reflect events at the distant end of the relevant period.  In those circumstances the modest degree of over-compensation which a valuation based on life-expectancy would entail is in my view justifiable by the needs of practical justice.  In this connection I note what Irwin LJ says at para. 205 of his judgment.  The difference between, on the one hand, acknowledging a degree of over-compensation because of the impossibility of devising a workable way of avoiding it and, on the other, pragmatically treating uncertainties of this kind as part of an overall fair and reasonable assessment seems to me rather elusive; but I think the former description is better because more transparent. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The final question is how to assess the present value of the notional reversionary interest.  Effectively what that means is identifying an annual rate by which the value should be discounted for the period between the assessment and the predicted date of death.  I agree with Irwin LJ that a market rate approach is right in principle, and if there were an active market in such interests we could simply take the established rate.  However, in my view Mr Watson’s evidence does not establish that there is (at present) a sufficiently active market to yield such a rate.  The rate must thus be chosen by the court (as the “deferment rate” was by the Lands Tribunal in the <span style="font-style:italic">Earl Cadogan</span> case), but an important element in its decision must be such evidence as there is about what investors are prepared to pay for broadly analogous interests.  For that purpose Mr Watson’s evidence about the limited number of transactions which he identifies does have real value.  Having regard to that evidence and the other factors identified by Irwin LJ, I agree with him that the rate in this and similar cases should be 5%.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimant suffered an above knee amputation as a result of a road traffic accident.  As at the date of the accident he was not working and was in receipt of a state pension.  He lived alone in a rented one bedroom first floor flat.  He was fully mobile and independent in all aspects of everyday living. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimant requires prosthetics for life.  However, as a result of his injuries he will be a regular wheelchair user and requires a wheelchair accessible adapted ground floor property.  The Judge finds that the Claimant will be unable to adapt a rental property to meet his needs and will have to purchase a property in order to carry out the agreed adaptations [door widening, level access shower/wetroom, widened passageways for wheelchair access, adapted kitchen and so on].    </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Judge finds that the Claimant will require 35 hours of care to age 80 and live in care in the final two years of life.  Absent his injuries, the Claimant would not have required any paid care and assistance. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Judge finds that the Claimant requires a three bedroom bungalow<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.39in"> One of the bedrooms will be converted to create a level access en suite wetroom for the Claimant. </p>
	      </authorialNote> which can be adapted to create a suitable bathroom, wheelchair accessible rooms and a bedroom/carer’s suite for live in care. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The cost of a three bedroom bungalow in the Claimant’s area is £250,000.  The cost of adaptations is £150,000.  The Claimant’s annual rental charges were and would have remained, absent his injuries, £80 p.w. which would have been met in full by Housing Benefit. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Judge finds that purchase and adaptation of a bungalow would be a reasonable solution to meet the Claimant’s reasonable needs.  The alternative is for the Claimant to rent a 3 bedroom bungalow and to adapt the property.  Rental costs of a bungalow would be £1,000 pcm and adaptation costs would be the same as before [£150,000].  The Claimant would have to make good the adaptations and restore the property to its previous unadapted state.  The Judge rejects this solution due to (i) uncertainty that Claimant will have a secure tenancy for the rest of his life, and (ii) the risk that further adaptations might have to be carried out in the event that the Claimant is forced to move. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Claimant’s expert evidence is that the Claimant’s life expectancy is 10 years; the Defendant’s expert evidence is that it is 5 years.  The Judge finds that it is likely to be 7 years. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">The Judge’s findings in relation to the other heads of loss were as follows: </p>

If such a flat rate PPO was made, the retained lump sum [excluding future accommodation] would be £562,595.
