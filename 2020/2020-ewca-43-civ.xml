One of the units Was required for the construction of the HS2 railway. The issue on this appeal is whether Anixter sewed counter-notices in time under the relevant compulsory purchase legislation, such as to trigger its potential ability to require the acquisition Of its interests in all four buildings. That, in turn, gives rise to two sub-issues:</p>

The notice informed the company of HS2S intention to acquire Unit R, but not its other buildings at Saltley Park. At the same time, and as a precautionary measure, notice was also given under s.6 of the 1981 Act Of the making of a general vesting declaration (a "GVD") including Unit R. The GVD stated that the land comprised within it would vest in the acquiring authority as from the end of the period of three months from the date of completion of service of notices after the making of the GVD. (In the event, that date turned out to be 13 March 2018). The notices were sent by both ordinary and recorded delivery post; and were delivered to and received at Anixter's registered office on 12 December 2017.</p>

The envelope containing notice of the GVD was delivered and signed for by a member of Anixter's post room staff. Mr Brookes was away on business at the time. The envelope stated on the outside that it was from HSB Land &amp; Property Team and warned that "this letter affects your property". Because the letter was not addressed to Mr Brookes by name it was not scanned and emailed to him by the post room staff, as Anixter's procedures would Otherwise have required. Because Anixter does not have a company secretary the letter was not immediately delivered to any individual, nor was it given to Anixter's facilities manager (as its procedures ordinarily required) because that post was temporarily vacant and being covered by Mr Brookes. Instead the envelope was left unopened on MT Brookes' desk to await his return; and although he telephoned his office daily during his absence he was not alerted to its arrival.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.06in">Ever since the early days of compulsory purchase Parliament has recognised that if an acquiring authority only requires part of a person's land holding, that may cause the landowner significant harm. Thus, beginning with section 92 of the f.ands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, the legislation has provided that in certain circumstances a person cannot be Compelled to Sell part Of his land holding if he is willing to Sell the whole. The landowner signified his willingness to sell the whole by counter-nouce given to the acquiring authority. Thai rule was repeated in section 8 of the 1965 Act. Neither Of those two Acts laid down any particular time limits for the exercise of the right to require a sale of the whole. If counter-notice is given the acquiring authority must decide whether to take the whole, or to abandon the acquisition. It is that right which Anixter wishes to exercise.</p>

Its purpose is to short-circuit the lengthier process of notice to treat followed by notice of entry. Execution Of a GVD is (after preliminary notice) a single-step process which vests title to subject land automatically in the acquiring authority without need for formal conveyance or investigation of title. It is of particular value to an acquiring authority where many titles are to be acquired or where the investigation of title may be complex. It also simplifies the date for assessment of compensation, which will be measured as at the vesting date.</p>

The specific phrase "a long tenancy about to expire" (with a definition in terms similar to that in section 2 (2) of the 1981 Act) made its first appearance in the Town and Country Planning Act 1944. Its use within the procedure for general vesting declarations can be traced to the Land Commission Act 1967. Ai any rate in 1944 (if not in 1967) the protection given to business tenancies was fat more limited. In most cases it was restricted to the payment of cornEvnsation under the I-andlord and Tenant Act 1927. Accordingly, when Parliament first adopted the definition Of "a long tenancy about to expire" there was no question of any continuation of a tenancy consequent upon the tenant's continued occupation, Now that the mechanism for conferring security Of tenure on business tenants bas changed, the definition must be applied to the new legal landscape.</p>

If (as Mr Morshead accepts) when the definition was first adopted Parliament had its gaze fixed on the contractual term of the tenancy, why should the meaning Of the same definition have changed subsequently? Even under Part of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 there is a clear conceptual difference between the tenancy and the contract that created it. •Diat is why (under the old law) an original tenant was not liable for rent falling due after the contractual term date: City ofLondon Corporation v Fell [1994] 1 AC 458. It is also why service by the landlord of notice under a break clause terminates the contract, but not the tenancy.</p>

Mr Benjamin was the tenant of a shop in Upton Park which he occupied for the purposes of his business. His lease was limited to expire on 24 June 1966. West Ham BC served him with notice to treat On 30 July 1965. ne general Tuie was that compensation was to be assessed at the date of the notice to treat. But if a tenancy created "no greater interest than a tenant from year to year" then, under section 121 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, compensation would not be assessed until the acquiring authority required possession. Dealing with Mr Benjamin's tenancy, uyrd Denning MR said:</p>

On July 30, 1965, when the notice to treat was given, the claimant had a "short tenancy": for the simple reason that his lease at that date had less than One year to rün. He had "ao greater interest therein than a tenant for a year Or from year to year" within section 121 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845. His lease expired on June 24, 1966, and he held over under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954. His interest then too was a "short tenancy" for it was "no greater than a tenant from year to year." It was so held, quite rightly, by the Lands Tribunal in Selborne (Gowns) Ltd v Ilford Borough Council. It is true that apart from the compulsory acquisition, he would have been entitled to apply for a new tenancy. But Parliament has enacted that his compensation under section 121 is to be assessed without regard to his right to apply for a new tenancy, see section 39 (1) of the Act of 1954. It expressly says that he is to be no worse off than if his landlord intended to demolish the premises or wanted them for his own business, see section 39 (2), in which case he would have been compensated by being paid twice the rateable value, see section 37 (2) Of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954 .

It is first instructive to consider Ibe phrase which section 2 (2) sets out to define. It is "a long tenancy which is about to expire". It is well established that the choice of the term to be defined is relevant in interpfeling a definition: see, for example MacDonald v Dextra Accessories Ltd [2005] UKHL 47, [20051 4 All ER 107; Walker v Birmingham CC [2007) UKHL 22, 12007) 2 AC 262.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in">53 Clearly, the definition contemplates a tenancy which will expire at some point. The date of expiry of a tenancy is its contractual term date, It goes too far to say that a tenancy protected by Part LI of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 will not expire. It may well do, if the tenant is not in occupation on the contractual termination date. In many cases, DO doubt, the acquiring authority will have taken possession On the Vesting date so that the tenant will no longer be in occupation oa that date; which is the date as at which the Statutory question must be answered. So there is nothing in the term defined by section 2 (2) which would exclude a tenancy protected by Part 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.</p>

The focus of the language is on what was granted i.e. on the contractual term and, implicitly, on the period of that contractual term which is still to run.

That is why it requires the positive assumptions that any option to renew is exercised and that any right to terminate is also exercised. is common ground that the "options" referred to ill paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 2 (2) are contractual options Only. In the case Of a landlord's right to terminate, termination Of the contractual tenancy does not necessarily determine the tenancy itself, if the tenant is in occupation. The utility of section 2 (2) (b) would be seriously diminished if the tenant's continuing tight to remain in occupation were ahowed to cut across the clear statutory assumption in that paragraph.</p>

It was initially replaced by section 47 Of the Land Compensation Act 1973; and section 47 has itself been amended by the Neighbourhood and Planning Act 2017. In its original form section 47 applied where an acquiring authority acquired the interest of either the landlord or the tenant in land subject to a tenancy to which Part Il of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 applied. In such a case the right Of the tenant to apply for a new tenancy was to be taken into account "in assessing the compensation payable" either to the landlord or to the tenant. In its current form, section 47 applies to all tenancies where before the acquisition the tenant was carrying on a trade or business on the land. In such a case, then in "assessing the compensation payable by the authority to the landlord or the tenant" under section 121 of the unds Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 or section 20 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.05in">tenancy about to expire. The assessment of compensation is a valuation exercise, in which the valuer can assess the present value of all potential advantages which the owner of the interest has by virtue of his ownership. in making that assessment the valuer may take into account future possibilities, such as "hope value" for future development, suitably discounted to reflect the element Of uncenainty. How ülose possibilities are translated into hard cash is, in the end, a matter of expert opinion. Thus, in prescribing certain possibilities to be taken into account in æssessing compensation, Parliament was not doing anything out Of the ordinary in the context Of valuation. Third, the Pointe Gourde principle (i.e. that compensation should not be diminished as a result Of the scheme underlying the compulsory purchase) applies to the assessment Of compensation: Pointe Gourde Quarrying Transport co v SubIntendent ofCrown Lands [1947] AC 565. Section 47 reflects that principle. but the Pointe Gourde principle does not apply to the identification Of the interest to be acquired: Minister of Transport v Pettit (1968) 20 P &amp; CR 344; Rugby Joint Wafer Board v Footrit [1973) AC 202. In so far as Mr Morshead sought to rely on this principle to identify the interest to be acquired, I consider that such reliance was misplaced. Fourth, it is COtnmoø ground that the value of Anixter's tenancy is to be assessed in accordance with section 47, with the Consequence that the measure Of compensation is unaffected by its inclusion in or exclusion from the definition Of "long tenancy about to expire". In financial terms, therefore, it is no worse off.</p>
