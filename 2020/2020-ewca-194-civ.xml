The judge, Mr Steven Kovats QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge), ruled that it was impossible, without conducting a full trial of the claim, to determine whether there was any causal connection between the claim for judicial review and the offer of accommodation made to and accepted by the appellant shortly before the claim was due to be heard. The appellant submits that this represented a failure to apply the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">M v Croydon</span> and that the judge failed to take account of factors which should have resulted in an award of costs in her favour. </p>

She was pregnant at the time with her sixth daughter. She was a victim of severe domestic violence, spoke no English and had limited mobility. She applied for leave to remain and was accommodated with her daughters by the Secretary of State in a series of temporary accommodation units. In October 2018 the family was granted leave to remain and was given a month’s notice, expiring on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2018, to leave the accommodation provided by the Secretary of State.  </p>

After an initial interview she was provided with a Personal Housing Plan (“PHP”) pursuant to section 189A of the Housing Act 1996. This recorded that the appellant found stairs difficult to manage and that the interviewing officer had asked her to provide a letter confirming her medical problems. It went into no further detail concerning the appellant’s housing needs, save that the accommodation was to be for herself and her six daughters.   </p>

The letter referred to the urgent need for accommodation on or before 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November and complained that the PHP provided on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October had included no assessment of the appellant’s housing needs. It said that the appellant needed self-contained accommodation and (but presumably alternatively) single-sex accommodation because of the extreme domestic violence the family had experienced. It needed also to be close to the schools attended by the children. A letter dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 from the appellant’s GP was enclosed referring to mobility problems. The letter concluded by requiring the council to do three things: (1) to provide a copy of its file on the appellant; (2) to confirm that an urgent assessment of housing needs would be carried out; and (3) to provide self-contained accommodation in the borough on or before 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2018. </p>

Although described as a single room, it was in fact two rooms with a corridor (but no doors) between them, with shared access to bathroom and toilet facilities, and a shared kitchen and living room. On the same day the appellant was interviewed and an accommodation needs assessment form was completed. </p>

The response did not address the points set out in some detail by the appellant’s solicitors, but went straight to the three demands which they had made. As to these, the council (1) agreed to provide a copy of the appellant’s housing file, (2) confirmed that an assessment of housing needs had now been carried out, and (3) advised that an offer of accommodation had been made (i.e. in the hostel) which the appellant had accepted. </p>

She contended that the council had breached both the duty owed to her under section 189A of the Housing Act 1996 to produce a lawful PHP (because, she said, the PHP initially provided had included no assessment of her housing needs) and the duty to provide suitable accommodation. She sought (1) a mandatory order requiring the council to secure suitable accommodation for herself and her daughters, (2) a declaration that the accommodation provided for her was not suitable for a family of seven, and (3) a declaration that the council had failed adequately or at all to comply with its duty to prepare a lawful PHP. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant sought also an interim order requiring the family to be moved to suitable accommodation. At the hearing of that application on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2018 the council argued that the accommodation provided was suitable in the short term, that is to say for a period of up to 56 days (although in the event the appellant and her daughters were to remain there for rather longer than this), bearing in mind the extreme shortage of accommodation for large families in the borough and the appellant’s unwillingness to move away from the area which would mean the children having to change schools. It agreed to make a prompt decision on whether to accept that it owed the appellant a full housing duty under section 193 of the 1996 Act. It agreed also to carry out some work to improve the rooms which had been provided. On that basis the application for interim relief was withdrawn. Some work was carried out to deal with the most obvious problems with the hostel rooms: blinds were provided, gaps in doors were sealed, additional furniture was provided and furniture was placed in the bathrooms. But the fundamental problems of overcrowding and shared use of bathroom and toilet facilities remained. </p>

The appellant requested a review of this determination under section 202 of the Act, but the council confirmed its decision on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2018.

Thus the fact that the claimant has succeeded in obtaining part of the relief he sought may justify his recovering some of his costs, for instance where the issue on which the claimant succeeded was clearly the most important and/or expensive issue. But in many such cases the court may consider that it cannot fairly award the claimant any costs because, for instance, it is not easy to assess whether the defendants should have their costs of the issue on which the claimant did not succeed, and whether that would wipe out the costs which the claimant might recover in relation to the issue on which he won.” </p>

However, where there has been a settlement, the court will, at least normally, be in a significantly worse position to make findings on such issues than where the case has been fought out. In many such cases the court will be able to form a view as to the appropriate costs order based on such issues; in other cases it will be much more difficult.

The claimant challenged the suitability of temporary accommodation, a room in a hostel which he had to share with his wife and two daughters, but by the time his appeal came before the County Court judge, he was approaching the top of the housing list. The judge adjourned the appeal and, before the case came back, the claimant accepted an offer of a two-bedroom maisonette. The appeal therefore became academic. The judge was unable to say whether it was the bringing of proceedings which had focused the council’s mind or whether the claimant would have been offered the alternative accommodation in any event. He was also unable to say whether the claimant’s challenge would have succeeded if the claim had been fought out. Accordingly he made no order for costs. On an appeal to the High Court, Supperstone J affirmed this order, holding that there was no error of law in the judge’s approach. </p>

The claimants, who were ineligible for housing assistance due to their immigration status, sought an assessment under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to determine if accommodation could be provided on the basis that the child claimants were children in need. They were dissatisfied with the progress of that assessment and commenced judicial review proceedings, contending that the local authority had delayed unlawfully in carrying it out. A week later the assessment was completed and temporary accommodation was provided. The claim for judicial review was withdrawn, but the claimants contended that they should be awarded their costs as the successful party. The judge found that the completion of the assessment had nothing to do with the claim for judicial review and made no order for costs. That decision was upheld on appeal.

I do not believe that the Appellants can succeed in their claim for costs in this case on the conventional <span style="font-style:italic">R (M) v Croydon</span> basis – that is, that they obtained substantially the relief sought and are accordingly to be viewed as the successful party. Although in broad terms the relief sought was the provision of accommodation, such relief was not, as Moylan LJ demonstrates, available as a matter of law. More accurately, what the Appellants were seeking was an assessment under section 17 of the 1989 Act, which might (and indeed eventually did) lead to the provision of accommodation. At the time that the proceedings were issued there was no dispute between the Appellants and the Council that it was under an obligation to carry out such an assessment: it had indeed started, to the Appellants' knowledge, some time prior to the commencement of proceedings. The object of the proceedings was not to secure an assessment but to secure it sooner than it was feared would otherwise be the case. That being so, the fact that the assessment was in fact completed, and that the Appellants were accommodated accordingly, does not represent ‘success’: that would have happened anyway. I thus agree with Moylan LJ that that outcome was not the result of the proceedings. In a case of this kind the measure of ‘success’ has to be whether as a result of the proceedings being brought the assessment was completed substantially sooner than it otherwise would have been. I can see no reason for supposing that to have been the case here, and indeed given the time-scales it seems very unlikely. Accordingly, I do not think it would be fair to award the Appellants their costs simply on the basis that they were ‘the successful party’.” </p>

The first is that success may consist not only of obtaining the relief which the claimant was seeking, but also of obtaining it earlier than would otherwise have been the case. In some cases accommodation may be provided because a claimant happens to have reached the head of the queue and would have done so regardless of any legal challenge. In others, however, a local authority may always have accepted a duty to provide suitable accommodation, but the result of legal proceedings may be that it gives greater attention to a claimant’s situation than it would otherwise have done and, having done so, gives greater priority to her case. That can fairly be regarded as success, although it is fair to add that priority to one claimant may mean a longer wait for another.  </p>

It would not be concerned so much with whether the claimant would have won if the proceedings had continued, but rather with the distinct question of what factors had influenced the conduct of the local authority’s housing department in offering accommodation to one family rather than another. In circumstances where hard decisions often have to be made about the allocation of scarce resources and fairness between applicants for housing, many of whom will have urgent needs, this would not necessarily be a simple matter.

Indeed the issue of causation would only arise on the footing that the appellant had obtained at least much of what she sought, so it is necessarily implicit in the judge’s reasons that he accepted the appellant’s case on this question.

For example, it appears that the report from Dr Walsh may have led the council to accept that the appellant’s case was more urgent than it had previously accepted, and that the explanation for the timing of the offer may not have been as simple as saying that the six families previously ahead of the appellant had been accommodated so that the appellant had reached the head of the queue.

The position appears to be that although the appellant’s solicitors were asserting that the appellant needed self-contained or single-sex accommodation from the outset, the council had indicated that it would need medical evidence to support that assertion, which was only provided in Dr Walsh’s report. Once it was provided, the council did accept that the appellant urgently needed self-contained accommodation, acted promptly to source this, and succeeded in doing so. The council’s request for that evidence was independent of the judicial review claim and was part of its ongoing review of the appellant’s housing needs. Although the appellant’s solicitors appear to have played a part in obtaining the medical report, it is at least open to question whether in these circumstances the offer of accommodation made following its receipt should be regarded as having been caused by the claim for judicial review.

While at first sight there was a strong case that (what on one view could be described as) a single room with shared facilities is unsuitable for a mother and her six daughters, it was in reality two rooms separated by a corridor which was only ever intended to be temporary, some of its more glaring defects had been remedied, and for some periods in the past the family had previously been placed in similar hostel accommodation without it appearing that this was intrinsically unacceptable in the short term. Suitability is a highly fact-specific issue and the question would have been whether the council’s position was irrational. In these circumstances the judge was entitled to conclude that it would not have been practicable without going into the matter in more detail than would have been appropriate to say who would have been the successful party if the matter had been fought out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge did not expressly address the appellant’s complaints about the council’s conduct, but these were makeweights at most. The first complaint was that the council had failed to respond to the pre-action letter. But that letter was sent before the council had made any offer of accommodation at all, and the council did respond by addressing the three specific action points which it had been required to address, including the offer of the temporary hostel room. While the appellant did not accept that this room was suitable even in the short term, it is unrealistic to think that the council could have provided self-contained accommodation for this family on a few days’ notice. The remaining criticisms were that (1) the council had made a late concession at the interim relief hearing which made that hearing unnecessary, (2) the council had not provided its skeleton argument for the substantive hearing (which was due before the claim had settled but after the alternative accommodation had been provided), and (3) the council’s argument that the starting point was that the appellant should pay the council’s costs because the claim had been withdrawn was unreasonable. In my judgment these had little if any substance in the circumstances of this case. </p>

At all events, it is impossible for us to say that this was an exercise of discretion which was not open to him. His decision involved no error of law which would entitle this court to interfere and was neither unjust nor perverse. </p>
