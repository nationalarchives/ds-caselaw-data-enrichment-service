It is common ground that during the course of 2018-2019 J lived, first in Lincolnshire with her adoptive father (“the father”), then in Cheshire East with her birth brother (“DB”) and finally in Salford with her birth mother (“the mother”). The appeal centres upon a dispute between these three local authorities as to whether those periods of time when J lived with DB and with her mother should be disregarded for the purposes of determining her ordinary residence and therefore in designating the appropriate local authority.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before turning to the merits of the appeal, I intend to deal with a case management issue raised by Lincolnshire. Mr Roche QC on behalf of Lincolnshire submits that, even if it could be said that the judgment lacked detailed analysis, the authorities require the court to conduct only a rapid and not oversophisticated review when faced with a dispute as to the designation of a local authority. This, he said, the judge had done and this court should not now go behind the judge’s decision. In support of this submission, Mr Roche raises an important matter, namely the need to prevent a repeat of what has happened in this case, that is to say, the expenditure of significant time, effort and cost by each of the three hard-pressed and cash-strapped local authorities incurred in the resolution of this dispute. I would add to that, the need to avoid a disproportionate amount of court and judicial time being spent on resolving such an issue. </p>

Further, he accepted that the financial implications for Salford as a local authority have no legal relevance in deciding the outcome of a designation dispute. Mr Goodwin explained that, notwithstanding that being the case, given the implications for Salford, the authority had felt unable to accept the judge’s decision on the pragmatic ‘swings and roundabouts’ approach endorsed by Ward LJ. Mr Goodwin told the court that before the crisis in J’s life which had precipitated applications for care, secure accommodation and deprivation of liberty orders, she was a child who had spent just 3 months of her 16 years in their local authority area. The financial consequence of Salford becoming the designated local authority for J in financial terms was, at the point the appeal was lodged, estimated to be in the region of £550,000 including the cost of £30,000 per month to cover the cost of her placement at a secure unit. </p>

In those circumstances it would have been prudent, once each of the local authorities had had an opportunity to consider each other’s case notes, for they or their representatives to make a concerted attempt to agree a chronology, or failing that, to produce a single chronology highlighting areas of disagreement where relevant. Instead the court was presented with three separate chronologies. These chronologies most closely resemble a pick-and-mix of facts and opinion seemingly designed solely to assist the case of the party producing the document. Chronologies should not be interwoven with opinion, nor should it be the judge’s job to cross-check them in order to establish what is, and what is not, agreed by the parties.   </p>

Whilst the judge reserved judgment precisely because of the volume of paper he had been given, he cannot have been expected to have read and cross referenced all the material, and in my judgment it is little wonder that errors crept in. It is just unfortunate that one, namely Lincolnshire’s state of knowledge when J moved from the home of DB to that of her mother, was a matter of considerable significance. </p>

This, the only truly settled period in this unhappy young woman’s life, came to an abrupt end in 2010 when J’s adoptive mother died.  Thereafter, J lived with her father. Things were not easy, J suffers from severe attachment disorder and as she approached adolescence, her relationship with her father came under increasing pressure notwithstanding support from both sets of grandparents.

However even if that is the case, in my judgment the very latest the duty could have been said to arise was on 11 February when the father rang CM in tears saying J had run away and that he would not have her back. The fact that the local authority was not able to comply with that duty by providing accommodation either: (i) between 8 February and 11 February because they were unable to find anyone willing to have care for J; or (ii) overnight on 11/12 February because J had gone missing, does not, in my judgment, contrary to the submission of Mr Roche, mean that the duty had not arisen.   </p>

If that condition is satisfied, as it was here, the section 20 (1) duty arises immediately and the authority must take steps to ensure that accommodation is provided.

I would however, with respect, wholly endorse the view of Christopher Clarke LJ that the s 20 CA 1989 duty to provide accommodation arises when it appears to the local authority that the child requires accommodation as a consequence of the matters specified in section 20. It does not, therefore, matter when J became a looked after child, because the duty arose to accommodate her by virtue of the application of the factors in s20 CA 1989 which arose on 11 February at the latest and not on 12 February when the father telephoned DB. Thereafter Lincolnshire could no more ‘sidestep’ that duty by facilitating the move to DB, than they could have finessed it away under the pretext of acting under their general s17 CA 1989 duty (<span style="font-style:italic">H, Barhanu &amp; B v. L.B. Wandsworth [2007] 2 FLR 822</span>). As Christopher Clarke LJ said at [41] “… in respect of a child in need who requires accommodation there is no period when no duty arises.”  </p>

Whenever a child is taken into care, the local authority always looks to place the child with a friend or relative. Indeed, pursuant to s22(6)(a) and (7)(a) CA 1989, when determining the most appropriate placement for a looked after child, the local authority “must” give preference to such a placement. But even before a child formally becomes a looked after child pursuant to s22(2) CA 1989, when the duty to accommodate a child under s20(1) CA 1989 first arises, parents are always asked to put forward the names of possible alternative carers in the same way as they do in care proceedings.

I would add in this regard that no criticism can or should be made of the direct social work and the support that J received from both CM and her Early Help Worker. From my review of the case notes it is clear that they did all in their power to support J, but, as was noted in CM’s supervision, the challenges presented by J were simply too great to be managed and for J to remain at home became unsustainable. </p>
