In around 2011, he sold the business to Vicinity Group Limited which subsequently went into administration. GSW acquired the business from the administrators.  Mr Shelmerdine was initially retained as an employee. It was Mr Shelmerdine, (amongst others) who visited locations outside the United Kingdom, organised the relevant map and the advertisers, before moving on to another luxury hotel.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In July 2015, GSW, Mr Shelmerdine and DLS Media Limited, Mr Shelmerdine’s company, entered into a consultancy agreement in which DLS Media Ltd was defined as the “Consultant” and Mr Shelmerdine as the “Provider” (the “Consultancy Agreement”). In the Consultancy Agreement it was recorded that GSW carried on the business of producing advertising-based maps for distribution in four and five star hotels and that it required specialist services relating to advising, assisting and selling advertising to appear on the maps across the world. It was also recorded that the Consultant was in the business of providing personnel, that it could supply the Provider, Mr Shelmerdine, and that he had the appropriate skills and was willing to make himself available outside the United Kingdom only, through the Consultant, to provide the consultancy services. The appointment was to commence on 6 April 2015 and to continue until 6 April 2017, or such later date as the parties might agree. Amongst other things, at clause 10 the Consultancy Agreement contained posttermination covenants in relation to enticing away employees of managerial status and above, enticing away suppliers and introducers of business, solicitation, canvassing and dealing with customers and competition with the “Relevant Business” in the “Prohibited Area” (both of which terms being defined). The restrictions in the covenants applied for a duration of 12 months after the cessation of the consultancy.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Shelmerdine was also a shareholder of GSW. He was party to a shareholders’ agreement dated 15 June 2016 which was made between GSW and the persons listed in schedule 1 to the agreement who were referred to as “Shareholders”, of whom Mr Shelmerdine was one (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”). It will be necessary to consider the Shareholders’ Agreement in some detail. At this stage, however, it is sufficient to note that at clause 5 it also contained a number of covenants including a post termination non-competition covenant and restrictions in relation to the solicitation of clients or customers, and the solicitation of employees and suppliers. It is the proper construction of those covenants which is at the centre of this appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The fixed term of the Consultancy Agreement having expired, Mr Shelmerdine continued to provide services to GSW through his company, known by that time as Destination Luxury Sales Limited. He did so on the understanding that commission would be payable pending a new agreement. There were lengthy negotiations in this regard which, by mid-2018, had culminated in a travelling draft of a new consultancy agreement. At clause 10, the draft contained a series of covenants which provided that Destination Luxury Sales Limited as the Consultant and Mr Shelmerdine as the Provider should not, for a period of six months after termination of the agreement, be engaged or interested in any capacity or otherwise in any other business which carries on “Relevant Business” as defined. There were also restrictions lasting for twelve months from the termination of the agreement in relation to enticing away employees of managerial status and above, enticing away suppliers and introducers of business, and the solicitation, canvassing and dealing with customers or clients and those whom GSW was negotiating in relation to the “Relevant Business”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, the negotiations faltered and the ad hoc consultancy arrangements between GSW and Mr Shelmerdine were terminated by notice which expired on 9 February 2019. It is not in dispute that as a result of the termination of the agency, Mr Shelmerdine was deemed to have served a transfer notice in respect of his shares in GSW pursuant to article 22.3 of the Articles of Association of GSW. As I understand it, nevertheless, Mr Shelmerdine remains a shareholder at present.  </p>

Having failed to receive a satisfactory response, proceedings were issued on 1 April 2019 seeking an injunction restraining breach of post-termination covenants in the Shareholders’ Agreement and what was referred to as the new Consultancy Agreement in the form of the travelling draft. An injunction to restrain Mr Shelmerdine from misusing confidential information belonging to GSW was also sought.  </p>

In the event, GSW decided not to pursue the application for an interim injunction in relation to non-competition, and the return date was vacated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the judge turned to the proper interpretation of the restrictions contained in clause 5 of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Having noted that the scope of the restrictions was clear, the judge commented at [44] of the judgment that the restrictions only apply to “Employee Shareholders”, not the shareholders as a whole. Having considered the definition of “Employee Shareholder” the judge concluded that on a proper construction of clause 5 and the relevant definitions, if an employee, agent or director ceases to be an Employee Shareholder he must also cease to be subject to the covenants at that time. Accordingly, he held that it was no longer open to GSW to advance a claim on the basis of the covenants in the Shareholders’ Agreement once Mr Shelmerdine ceased to be its agent in February 2019.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.46in;text-indent:0.00in">“44.  However, the restriction applies to “Employee Shareholders” only, not the shareholders as a whole. I have already referred to the difficult contractual definition of “Employee Shareholder” in clause 1.1 of the Agreement. Although denoted as “Employee Shareholders”, the class encompasses “employees, agents or directors who are not employees”. It thus includes employees but also agents and/or directors. It refers to “employees, agents or directors” in the present tense but, by way of clarification, it states that those employees who are Employee Shareholders at the date of the Agreement are identified in the table to Schedule 1. It is thus implicit that shareholders who were not employees, agents or directors at the time of the Agreement can become Employee Shareholders if they become employees, agents or directors after the Agreement. It is logically consistent with this that a Shareholder who ceases to be an employee, agent or a director ceases to be an Employee Shareholder at that point in time. However, if he does cease to be an Employee Shareholder at that point in time, he must also cease to be subject to the covenants at the same time.  </p>

If “Employee Shareholders” are limited in time to the period over which they are an employee, the agreement does not expressly extend their liability on the covenants following termination of their employment. Mr Budworth submitted that their continuing liability could be restricted to a period of 12 months in light of the 12 month restrictions in clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of the agreement. However, in my judgment, this confuses the treatment of their status as an employee with their status as a shareholder. The restrictions in clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 continue for a period of 12 months from the date when a party ceases to be a shareholder, but the 12 month restriction does not apply to his status as an employee. There is no room for the 12 month restriction to apply by implication to his status as an employee because it has not been drawn up with reference to his shareholder status only. Had it been intended to refer to his status as an employee, that could very easily have been achieved. The parties have elected not to draw up the agreement in that way.  </p>

Mr Budworth submitted to me that the logic of the provision is that the restrictions are a function of the Defendant’s rights and obligations as a shareholder. However, the restrictions are imposed on employee shareholders only as a specific class. The parties could have provided for a post 12-month restriction following his loss of status as an employee but did not do so. To imply a term to that effect, the claimant would have to satisfy the test of necessity in <span style="font-style:italic">Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas</span> [2015] UKSC 72.

The judge decided that if that interpretation were correct, GSW would have a legitimate business interest meriting protection, given that: the business is narrow and specific in nature; it has a particular modus operandi; it cannot function properly without records and that there was almost certainly a database relating to the identity and addresses of clients and their terms of business; and there will be a significant measure of goodwill.

He held that if the restrictions in clauses 5.1 to 5.4 of the Shareholders’ Agreement were construed so as to cease when Mr Shelmerdine ceased to have the status of an employee or agent, the restrictions would be reasonably necessary. If, however, as GSW alleged, the restrictions were apt to remain in effect as long as Mr Shelmerdine remained a shareholder, regardless of the length of time since he had ceased to be an employee/agent, then they were longer in duration than was necessary to protect the legitimate business interest.

He says that the covenant applies to Shareholder status and is not a substitute for the restraint which one might find in the employment contract or agency agreement.

It seems clear that the purpose of those rights and obligations, therefore, was, in general, to protect GSW, its goodwill and the value of its shares.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is also consistent with the compulsory transfer provisions in article 22.3 of the Articles of Association. That article makes clear that a person ceasing to be an “Employee” would immediately become subject to the compulsory transfer provisions and, therefore, be in the process of ceasing to be a Shareholder. It is, no doubt, for that reason that the definition of “Employee” for the purposes of the Articles includes “is or was”. It seems to me that the circumstances which troubled the judge, therefore, would not arise. If one ceases to be an Employee it is likely that one would cease to be a Shareholder relatively shortly thereafter. A Deemed Transfer Notice is treated as having been served once the Employee ceases to hold the position in question unless a position is taken up with another Group Company or the Shareholder Majority directs otherwise in writing. See the definition of “Departing Employee” in article 1.1 and article 22.3. The period during which such a person would be bound by the restriction in (a) of clause 5.1 would be likely, therefore, to be roughly co-terminous with one’s employment or in all likelihood would not continue for much longer and certainly would not be indefinite. Further, the period of 12 months referred to in (b) would start to run roughly from the date on which the person ceased to be an Employee and, in any event, there would not be an indefinite delay before that period began. Such an interpretation creates symmetry with the circumstances in which a person remains an Employee but relinquishes his shares. In such circumstances, at the outset, he is an Employee Shareholder to whom clause 5.1 applies. Once the shares are relinquished the period in (a) comes to an end and the period in (b) comes to an end 12 months thereafter.   </p>

It would have been understood that the process would have commenced immediately, that the timetable was relatively tight and that it was intended that a person who ceased to be an Employee would cease to be a Shareholder very shortly thereafter. GSW is a relatively small private company and the Shareholders’ Agreement, combined with the provisions of the Articles of Association, agreed and adopted at approximately the same time, require an outgoing Employee to cease to be a Shareholder under a relatively tight timetable, unless the Shareholder Majority agrees otherwise.  </p>

He says that Mr Shelmerdine is not locked in as a shareholder and, therefore, there is nothing objectionable about (a) or the 12-month period in (b) in clause 5.1. Mr Berragan says that the wording of the covenants make clear that the purpose of the restriction is to protect the company from misuse of information or connections acquired by a party in the role of employee or agent rather than as shareholder. He submitted, therefore, that whilst it is accepted that a restriction for a period of 12 months from the end of employment would be reasonably necessary to protect GSW’s legitimate business interests because within that period the employee would have information and contacts which he might use to the detriment of the business, the same was not true if the period of 12 months runs from cessation of the status of “Shareholder” as it does in (b) of clause 5.1. In part, his objection in such a case arises because he says that the period during which the former Employee may remain a Shareholder and, accordingly, subject to the restrictions as a result of (a) may be indefinite and will delay the beginning of the 12-month period under (b). He says that the judge’s reasoning at [49] – [54] and his conclusion that a former Employee may remain subject to the restrictions indefinitely and therefore, the restrictions are longer than is necessary to protect GSW’s legitimate business interests is right.  </p>

Firstly, it is clear that GSW has a legitimate interest in seeking to prevent Employee Shareholders from competing with the business and soliciting clients, given the particular nature of the business and the knowledge that such individuals are likely to have obtained. Secondly, the clause appears in a shareholders’ agreement made between experienced commercial parties. Thirdly, in my judgment, a period of restraint lasting 12 months was entirely reasonable to protect that interest. It seems to me that that is the case even though the 12 month period under clause 5.1(b) runs from the date on which the individual ceases to be a Shareholder rather than the cessation of his employment, agency or directorship. As I have already mentioned, in all likelihood, the cessation of employment, agency or directorship and ceasing to be a Shareholder will be co-terminous or, at least, there will be only a limited lapse of time between the cessation of employment and the disposal of the individual’s shares. Although I accept that delay in the process of relinquishing Shares in GSW is possible, I do not consider that the clause should be declared to be unreasonable on the basis of the relatively unlikely possibility that there may be considerable delay or the extreme and very unlikely possibility that a Shareholder may be locked in indefinitely.   </p>
