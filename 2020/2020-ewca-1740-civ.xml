A, very much, subsidiary issue is whether the judge was right in the circumstances of this case to rescind the Decree Nisi and set aside the certificate. </p>

The first dealt with an allegation of fraud, namely, as found by the judge, that the husband had falsely given the date of separation as 2006 when it was, in fact, 2016.  The second dealt with an issue of procedural irregularity, namely that the decree had been made absolute despite the wife’s application for the decree nisi to be rescinded not having been determined, contrary to r.7.32(2) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (“the FPR 2010”). </p>

The sole ground of appeal on which I gave permission to appeal, as formulated by me in the order giving permission to appeal, was that, in summary, the judge should not have set the Decree Absolute aside because there was no legal basis for doing so in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The only ground for divorce under s.1(1) of the MCA 1973 is that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.  At present, by s.1(2), the court can only find this established if the petitioner proves one of the five “facts” set out in subsections (a) to (d); the last of these is that the parties have been separated for at least five years.  It is appropriate to note that, under the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act 2020 (“the 2020 Act”), this will change and, as a result when it is in force, aspects of this judgment will become irrelevant.  This is because irretrievable breakdown will not depend on one of the facts set out in s.1(2) of the 1973 Act being proved but will be conclusively proved by a statement to that effect: s.1(3) of the 1973 Act as substituted by the 2020 Act. </p>

However, it was briefly addressed during the course of the hearing before us and the point was made by Mr Timson that, when the wife did seek to file the Acknowledgment of Service out of time, she did so on a form which had the names of the parties, the case number and the details about the court (including who had produced the document) included in print, whereas the details filled in by the wife were by hand.  This, he suggested, strongly supported the conclusion that the formal elements of the document had been completed by the court and that, accordingly, the Acknowledgement of Service had been served on the wife. </p>

I say this, emphatically not to encourage a respondent to defend a petition, but to draw attention to the fact that, if they do not respond to the petition as required under the FPR 2010, they are likely to find that they are unable later to contest the proceedings and the court will make a decree of divorce. </p>

He referred, at p. 13, to a number of “indications … of the importance that Parliament attaches to the certainty of the change of status arising out of a decree absolute”, which included s.31 of the Judicature Act 1925.  He concluded, accordingly, that failure to comply with s.33 rendered the decree absolute voidable rather than void.

This was somewhat controversial and, perhaps in part because of this, concerns quickly developed that divorces were being improperly obtained either because of collusion between the parties or because “material facts” were being withheld from the court.  The concerns and the steps taken in response were explained in the <span style="font-style:italic">Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce 1956 Report</span> (Cmnd. 9678) (“the <span style="font-style:italic">1956 Report</span>), at [947].   </p>

The Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, provided for a single decree of dissolution of marriage, leaving the parties free to marry again as soon as it was clear that there would be no appeal from the court's decision. Shortly after the passing of the Act of 1857, some anxiety was felt that parties were obtaining divorce decrees either collusively or without presenting material facts to the court. It appears that the judge found it extremely difficult to carry out the requirement that he should satisfy himself of the absence of bars to relief, in particular collusion, in undefended cases, where only one side of the case was presented to the court. To meet this criticism, it was provided by the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, that the court should pronounce in the first place a decree nisi, which would be followed by a decree absolute if no objection was raised within a period of three months. At the same time the Act of 1860 provided: </p>

For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">S v S (Rescission of Decree Nisi: Pension Sharing Provision)</span> [2002] 1 FLR 457, Singer J decided that there was power to set aside a decree nisi to enable the parties to take advantage of the new pension sharing provisions which did not apply retrospectively.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Price v Price</span> [2015] 1 FLR 1202, the Court of Appeal (Black LJ, as she then was, giving the judgment) allowed the husband’s appeal from the dismissal of his application to set aside the certificate and for permission to file an answer out of time even though the decree nisi had subsequently been pronounced.  A rehearing of the husband’s application was ordered, which, if granted, would necessarily have required the decree nisi to be set aside.   In the course of her judgment, Black LJ referred to a number of earlier authorities in which the court had set aside a decree nisi, in particular <span style="font-style:italic">Nash v Nash</span> [1968] P 597, which Black LJ described, at [10], as “the source of the modern approach”.  That case had identified “three classes of case” in which “a decree nisi should be set aside to enable a spouse who had not filed an answer prior to the grant of the decree to defend the divorce”.  I do not propose to set these out because, as summarised by Black LJ at [18], the court does not apply “a rigid test” but determines whether, “express[ing] matters in layman's language (and emphatically not attempting to set up yet another test) … there [is] … a real look of injustice about the case”. </p>

It is clear from these authorities that these circumstances are limited.  They are limited because a decree absolute is a declaratory judgment which conclusively determines a person’s marital status.  In addition to the parties, all public authorities and all other individuals are entitled to rely on the declaratory effect of the decree.  This can have significant consequences across a wide range of issues including, for example, the right to marry.  To take that example, if a prior decree absolute were set aside, any subsequent marriage would be void under s.11(b) of the MCA 1973.   </p>

As set out above, he was plainly referring to the court’s jurisdiction to entertain a petition and not the court’s power under s.1 of the MCA 1973 to grant a decree of divorce.  This is consistent with the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Bater v Bater</span> and the submissions made by the Queen’s Proctor in <span style="font-style:italic">Callaghan v Hanson-Fox</span> as to the circumstances in which a decree absolute had been held to be either void or voidable, which Sir Stephen Brown P accepted.

However, the second part of his judgment made clear that he also set the decree aside because of procedural irregularity, namely that the decree had been made absolute in breach of r.7.32(2) because the wife’s application to rescind the decree nisi was pending.  This, as Mr Timson rightly accepted, made the decree absolute voidable.  The judge was plainly entitled to decide to set the decree aside and, although he expressed his reasons very briefly, Mr Timson has not persuaded me that the judge’s decision was wrong or that there was any other flaw which would entitle this court to interfere with that decision. </p>
