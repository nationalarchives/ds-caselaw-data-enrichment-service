	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal is concerned with the question whether the Court has power to permit the Claimants to amend so as to introduce new claims after the expiry of the limitation period.  This issue is one that crops up frequently in litigation and has generated a substantial amount of authority, unsurprisingly since what is usually in issue is whether a claim which is otherwise statute-barred can be litigated at all, and hence the stakes are high.  This case is no exception: if the Claimants are not permitted to amend, that will put an end to the current action, and it is very doubtful if the Claimants would be able to bring another one.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal does however raise what appears to be a novel point.  In circumstances where the Court has struck out the entirety of the Claimants’ currently pleaded case, can the Court nevertheless subsequently permit new claims to be brought?   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case HHJ Simon Barker QC on 23 October 2018 struck out the latest version of the Claimants’ Particulars of Claim (the Re-amended Particulars of Claim or <span style="font-weight:bold">“RAPOC”</span>) against all the Defendants, of whom there were then seven, on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of any of the claims succeeding.  So far as the then 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Defendant was concerned, that was that.  HHJ Barker however thought that the Claimants might be able to re-cast their claims against the then 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants (now the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants and the current Appellants).  He therefore did not strike out the Claim Form.  That was deliberate, and intended to give the Claimants an opportunity, without having to start again, to see if they could reformulate their claims in a viable manner against those Defendants.  The Claimants took that opportunity and duly applied to amend by pleading a Re-re-amended Particulars of Claim (<span style="font-weight:bold">“RRAPOC”</span>).  The Claimants accepted that the claims in the RRAPOC were <span style="font-style:italic">“new claims”</span> and that they were, or arguably were, statute-barred and hence that they had to rely on the power of the Court in CPR r 17.4, which permits the Court to allow a new claim to be pleaded after the expiry of the limitation period, but only if the new claim arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a claim in respect of which the applicant has already claimed a remedy in the proceedings (CPR r 17.4(2)).   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That application also came before HHJ Barker and by his judgment dated 26 February 2020, given effect to by his Order dated 3 March 2020, he held that for the purposes of CPR r 17.4(2) he could compare the proposed new claims pleaded in the RRAPOC with the claims in the struck out RAPOC and that since they did arise out of the same or substantially the same facts as had been there pleaded he had power to allow the amendments, which he proceeded to do.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Defendants sought permission to appeal on a number of grounds.  HHJ Barker refused permission to appeal.  On 20 July 2020 permission was granted by David Richards LJ, but limited to a single ground, Ground 7, which was that HHJ Barker had no power to grant permission to amend because there was no claim <span style="font-style:italic">“in issue”</span> in the action, the existing claims all having been dismissed.  The words <span style="font-style:italic">“in issue”</span> do not appear in CPR r 17.4, but they do appear in s. 35 of the Limitation Act 1980 (<span style="font-weight:bold">“LA 1980”</span>), which is the section under which CPR r 17.4 was made: s. 35(4) and (5) permit rules of court to be made if the new cause of action arises out of the same, or substantially the same, facts <span style="font-style:italic">“as are already in issue on any claim previously made in the original action.”</span></p>

In summary these fall into three parts.  Grounds 1 to 3 advance further arguments why HHJ Barker was right to compare the RRAPOC with the RAPOC.  Ground 4 puts forward an alternative argument that the new causes of action arose out of the same or substantially the same facts as were in issue on the claims made by the Claim Form, and that the RAPOC could be looked at for that purpose.  Ground 5 invites the Court to vary HHJ Barker’s Order of 23 October 2018 under CPR r 3.1(7), or correct it under CPR r 40.12 (the slip rule), so as to delete the striking out of the RAPOC.      </p>

Mr Layas’s reaction was apparently to disinstruct Savills, and on 18 June to ask Mr King to assist.

It is not necessary to go into the reasons but some reliance was placed on the evolution of the pleadings so I will trace the history of that.  The Claim Form, together with Particulars of Claim, was served towards the very end of the four months available on 16 November 2016.  In February 2017 the Claimants served draft Amended Particulars of Claim; on 5 May 2017 the then 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants served a single Defence, pleading to the draft Amended Particulars of Claim (despite the fact that they had not yet been formally amended).  On 12 September 2017 Chief Master Marsh ordered the Claimants to serve the Amended Particulars of Claim by 20 October 2017, duly verified by a statement of truth, and on 20 October 2017 the Claimants did so in a version revised from that served in draft in February.   </p>

Apart from some tidying up and pleading of further details, the substantive change sought to be introduced was to widen the conspiracy claim to include King Sturge as one of the conspirators, and the only amendment to the Claim Form was to the same effect, namely to add King Sturge as a defendant to the conspiracy claim.  The amendments were not opposed by the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants (2018 Jmt at [2]); King Sturge did not oppose the amendments as such, on what is called the <span style="font-style:italic">Mastercard </span>basis (2018 Jmt at [2]), that is that for limitation purposes the amendments should be deemed not to date back to the issue of the Claim Form but to the date of the application to amend: see <span style="font-style:italic">Mastercard Inc v Deutsche Bahn AG </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 272 at [4] per Sales LJ where he held that the Court can permit an amendment on terms that for limitation purposes it should not date back to the date of issue of the claim form (as provided for by s. 35(1) LA 1980) but should take effect from some later date.  (This is a useful practice which avoids the need to issue a fresh action, and can have other uses; indeed in one of the last cases I heard in the High Court it was used to avoid what would otherwise have been a lengthy and costly interlocutory battle on CPR r 17.4(2) by the parties being persuaded to consent to an order permitting the amendment on terms that it would relate back either to the issue of the claim form or to a later date depending on whether the trial judge, who would be in a much better position to determine the point, concluded that it did or did not fall within CPR r 17.4(2)).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He then proceeded to consider that question, noting that CPR r 3.4(2)(a) provides that a court may strike out a statement of case if satisfied that it is bound to fail, and that CPR r 24.2 provides that the court may give summary judgment against a claimant if it considers that the claimant has no reasonable prospect of succeeding on the claim and there is no other compelling reason for a trial (2018 Jmt at [41]-[42]).  After a detailed consideration of the facts relied on by the Claimants he concluded that the case against King Sturge based on deceit, falsity, dishonest intention and state of mind was far-fetched and unrealistic (2018 Jmt at [119]), and that the suggestion that the Claimants relied on the King Sturge letter as a property valuation rather than a business valuation was untenable (2018 Jmt at [120]).     </p>

Mr Onslow relied on the terms of CPR r 17.4(2) and submitted that the proposed new claim arose out of the same facts as the claim previously made, and that this was within the language and ambit of CPR r 17.4(2).

The language of CPR r.17.4 requires there to be ongoing proceedings, which there are, and the assessment of the new claim to be made by comparison of the facts in the new claim to the facts in respect of which a remedy has already been claimed. At one level, that that is something that may be done is demonstrated by the fact that both sides’ legal teams have done it and expressed it, albeit somewhat differently, in schedules and detailed submissions. Further and importantly, the whole point of paragraph 3 of the 23.10.18 order was to permit the Claimants an opportunity to reformulate a claim focussed primarily against the Defendants and not KS because of, and therefore based on, the facts then pleaded. I note that the language of s.35 is rather different from CPR r.17.4, but the argument before me was as to the engagement of CPR r.17.4.

After further analysis his conclusion at [87] was that the proposed claim in the RRAPOC did not fall foul of CPR r 17.4.

The starting point is that CPR r 17.4 is a rule of court made in exercise of the power conferred by s. 35(4) LA 1980.  This was not disputed by Mr Onslow, who appeared, together with Ms Kate Holderness, for the Claimants on this appeal.  As such, by the express terms of s. 35(4), CPR r 17.4 could only provide for the Court to permit a new cause of action to be pleaded after the expiry of the limitation period in the circumstances specified in s. 35(5)(a).  That requires, in the case of a new cause of action, that the new cause of action arises out of the same, or substantially the same, facts as <span style="font-style:italic">are already in issue</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">on</span> a claim previously made in the action.

In that case the claimant had suffered a head injury in an accident on the defendant’s yacht and had no memory herself of the circumstances of the accident but had pleaded an account of it derived from another person present; the defendant had pleaded a quite different version of the facts in his defence, and the claimant wished to add, after the limitation period had expired, an alternative claim based on the defendant’s account.  The context was therefore very different from the present case, and the effect of reading the words <span style="font-style:italic">“are already in issue on”</span> into CPR r 17.4(2) was to widen its scope by permitting the claimant to rely on facts pleaded in the defence rather than just the particulars of claim (and as Mr Onslow reminded us, Brooke LJ only felt able to do this by reason of the interpretative obligation in s. 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998: see at [41]-[47]).

Suppose a claimant issues a claim and pleads two causes of action, A and B.  Some time later he drops cause of action B and deletes it from his pleading along with the facts relied on in support of it.  He then seeks to amend to add cause of action C which is by now statute-barred.  The Court can undoubtedly permit him to do so if the facts relied on in support of cause of action C are the same, or substantially the same, as the facts in issue on cause of action A.  But can the Court do so by comparing the facts relied on in support of cause of action C with the facts formerly pleaded, but now deleted, in support of cause of action B?  I would have thought the answer to that was plainly No, on the simple basis that those facts are no longer in issue and hence not facts that <span style="font-style:italic">“are … in issue” </span>at the time the Court is asked to grant permission.   </p>

I consider that the answer to that question emerges from considering the following example. Suppose that a claim form contains a concise statement as to the nature of two different claims, claim A and claim B. Both claim A and claim B are in time as regards limitation. Some time after the claim form is issued, it is amended to remove claim B. Some time later, the claimant wishes to amend the claim form again to reintroduce claim B, which is now out of time. Should the court hold that claim B is not a new claim because it was in the original claim form before amendment or should it consider that claim B is a new claim because it is not already in the claim form when the claimant applies to reintroduce it? I consider that the answer is clearly the second of these alternatives. It follows from this reasoning that when I consider the claim against the First Defendant as a joint tortfeasor which appeared in the particulars of claim served pursuant to the 2018 claim form, I should compare the claims in the particulars of claim with whatever remained in the 2015 claim form in 2018.”  </span>

Mr Onslow sought to distinguish <span style="font-style:italic">Carr v Formation Group plc</span> on the basis that here the Claim Form had not been struck out but had been deliberately kept in existence.  I agree, as I explain below, that this is a matter of some potential significance, but I do not see that it has any impact on the present question.  The October 2018 Order is to my mind entirely clear on the point.  It struck out the entirety of the RAPOC not only as against King Sturge (paragraph 2), but also as against the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants (paragraph 3.1), and none of the later paragraphs affect this.  By the time the Claimants’ application to amend came before HHJ Barker in May 2019, therefore, the RAPOC did not subsist, and the facts pleaded in it could not be said to be facts that <span style="font-style:italic">“are … in issue”</span>.  It was therefore wrong for HHJ Barker to embark, as he was asked to do and did, on a comparison between the facts in the RRAPOC and the RAPOC.  I come back below to what I think he should have been asked to do, but for the reasons I have given I consider that Mr Green is right on the simple point advanced by him under Ground 7. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Onslow advanced a number of submissions in answer to this point, which between them cover Grounds 1 to 3 in the Respondent’s notice.  Despite Mr Onslow’s eloquence I do not find any of them sufficiently persuasive to cause me to take a different view.  The first argument was that the relevant provision was CPR r 17.4(2); the CPR were made by the Civil Procedure Rule Committee established under the Civil Procedure Act 1997 (see ss. 1 and 2); the Committee had evidently interpreted s. 35(5)(a) LA 1980 as permitting them to make a rule in the form of CPR r 17.4(2); and that language was not ambiguous.  All of that may be true, but I do not see that it changes the analysis.  What the Committee may or may not have thought is ultimately not determinative, but it is very unlikely that they deliberately sought to introduce a form of rule in CPR r 17.4(2) that did not comply with s. 35(5)(a) LA 1980, and for the reasons I have given we are in any event bound to read CPR r 17.4(2) as if it contained the words <span style="font-style:italic">“are already in issue on”</span>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Onslow’s second argument was that it was not necessary that the facts in issue be facts in issue on a subsisting or extant claim; it was enough if the facts which underlay a previously pleaded claim were disputed, and reference to the RAPOC and the Defence showed what the facts were which were pleaded in the RAPOC, and which ones were disputed in the Defence.  In other words, although he did not put it quite this way, he was asking us to construe “<span style="font-style:italic">facts as are already in issue on a claim in respect of which the party applying for permission has already claimed a remedy in the proceedings”</span> as if it meant <span style="font-style:italic">“facts which were pleaded in a claim already made in the proceedings and which are disputed”</span>.  But this is not what it says.  I think that facts <span style="font-style:italic">“are in issue on a claim”</span> only if there is an extant claim which has not been resolved.  Once the claim has been resolved, whether by being dropped, or by being struck out, or by judgment being given on the claim either summarily or after trial, there is no longer a claim, and there therefore can be no facts in issue on that claim.  In the present case all the claims in the RAPOC had been struck out and so did not exist.  And although I agree that in a normal case where there is a full set of pleadings, </p>

That can be conveniently taken with his fourth submission, that the policy behind CPR r 17.4(2) was that identified by Colman J in <span style="font-style:italic">BP plc v Aon Ltd </span>[2005] EWHC 2554 (Comm) at [52] where he referred to what he had said at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic">Goode v Martin </span>[2001] 3 AER 562 as follows: </p>

And one can go further and say there would be nothing wrong in the claimant in such a case amending to plead claim B having already decided to drop claim A: as Mr Onslow pointed out, CPR r 17.4(2) expressly contemplates (as does s. 35(2)(a) LA 1980) that claim B can be pleaded in <span style="font-style:italic">substitution</span> for claim A, not just in addition to it.  In such a case it is obvious that claim A is no longer going to be litigated, but this does not stop the claimant relying on the facts in claim A to amend to bring in claim B, so long at any rate as he does it at a stage when claim A is still on the pleadings.  Conversely, CPR r 17.4(2) can be applied in circumstances where the defendant has not in fact investigated anything at all – indeed as I explain below, it may have to be applied where the claim form has just been served on the defendant and the defendant may know very little about it.

This argument was not developed at any length and the only authority cited was <span style="font-style:italic">Goode v Martin</span> where Brooke LJ held that if the rule prevented the claimant from relying on the facts pleaded by the defendant it would impose an impediment on her right of access to the court which would require justification, and that the rule so interpreted would not have any legitimate aim (at [43]-[44]).  We also received very short argument from Mr Green on the point.  He said that the Claimants’ right of access to the court had not been impeded: they had had by his count 7 attempts to plead their claim and had arguably had a far greater indulgence than many judges would have allowed them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not propose to consider the point at any length.  It is no doubt the case that any limitation defence can be said to impede the right of access of a claimant to the court, but there is no suggestion that limitation defences are unjustifiable <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> and indeed it is plainly justifiable in principle that there should be a system of limitation (with the result that some claimants will be unable to bring claims) as limitation has long been recognised to serve a public purpose: see <span style="font-style:italic">Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association Ltd v Trollope &amp; Colls (City) Ltd</span> (1986) 2 Const LJ 224 at 225 where May LJ referred to the interest of the public in seeing an end to litigation.  Once the principle of limitation is accepted, it seems to me inevitable, as well as in the interests of the parties, that there will be certain bright-line or hard-edged rules so that everyone knows where they stand; and one of those is the provision in s. 35 LA 1980 that once a claim is statute-barred, it cannot be added to an existing claim so as to defeat the limitation defence except in narrowly specified circumstances.  It also seems to me entirely justifiable that one of the rules is that found in s. 35(5)(a), namely that permission can only be granted if the new claim arises out of the same or substantially the same facts as those in issue on an existing claim in the action, and also justifiable that that should not extend to a claim arising out of facts that were formerly in issue on a claim that had at one stage been advanced but was no longer, for whatever reason, an extant claim.    </p>

Here the Defendants applied to strike out the Amended Particulars of Claim as early as 29 March 2018 (paragraph 20 above), and that gave the Claimants plenty of time before the hearing in October 2018 to consider whether they wished to bring forward any alternative claims in case the strike-out succeeded.  Had they applied to amend by bringing forward the claims now in the RRAPOC as an alternative at a stage when their existing pleading was still in existence, they might well have been able to do that.  By leaving it until after the claims in the RAPOC had been struck out they have run into the problems they have; but I do not think this means that the rule serves no legitimate aim, or is an unjustifiable restriction on their right of access to the court, or engages the interpretative obligation in s. 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">This follows the structure of the 2018 Judgment where HHJ Barker had dealt with the applications separately, first considering and deciding the Claimants’ applications and then turning to the Defendants’ application.  On the Claimants’ applications he was naturally only concerned to deal with the arguments raised, and as already set out (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above) on those applications the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants did not oppose the amendments, and King Sturge only opposed them on a narrow basis which the Judge rejected.  In those circumstances I see nothing wrong in his granting the Claimants’ applications before turning to the question whether the claims as so amended should be struck out, or in the way he reflected that in the October 2018 Order.  Indeed I think it was a logical way to structure it, and that it helps to make clear that the question of striking out was assessed by him against the Claimants’ latest version of their pleading.          </p>

I do not myself see that anything significant turns on this (and Mr Onslow for his part frankly accepted that the distinction between striking out and summary judgment was not something that one would see reflected in any of his thinking), but for what it is worth I think he was probably entitled to do that.  As Mr Green pointed out, the wording of CPR r 3.4 which confers the power to strike out is not in the same terms as the former RSC Ord 18 r 19.  CPR r 3.4(2)(a) provides that the Court may strike out a statement of case if it <span style="font-style:italic">“discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim”</span>; RSC Ord 18 r 19(1)(a) by contrast provided that the </p>

It is not obvious, at any rate to me, that the same is true under the CPR where the words <span style="font-style:italic">“no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim”</span> are rather looser than the former Ord 18 r 19(1)(a), and the former Ord 18 r 19(2) has not been reproduced.

This is admittedly poorly worded (as by paragraph 3.2 if the Claimants did these things there was nothing to stay as the unless order would not bite) but the Judge was very probably not personally responsible for the wording, the order being drafted by counsel in the normal way, and the meaning when read with paragraph 3.3(ii) is clear enough, namely that the question of the striking out of the Claim Form should be suspended pending the determination of the application to amend, but that if the amendment application were refused, the Claim Form should stand struck out, and the action be dismissed, without the need for any further order.  The practical effect of this does not seem to me to be in doubt, and, as Mr Green submitted, this infelicity does not in any event cast any doubt on the plain meaning of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Reverting to the steps in Mr Onslow’s argument, step (2) is that the Judge should have assessed the new claims against the claims in the Claim Form.  Again I agree.  The position the Claimants were in at the time of the hearing in May 2019 and following does not seem to me to be difficult to understand.  They had an extant Claim Form (in fact in an amended form as a result of paragraph 1 of the October 2018 Order, although the amendment, which solely concerned King Sturge, went nowhere).  They had no extant Particulars of Claim as the RAPOC had been struck out.  What in those circumstances I think they should have asked the Judge to do is first give them permission to re-amend the Claim Form, and then, if permission were granted, to serve the RRAPOC (as Arnold LJ pointed out in the hearing, this would not strictly be an amendment as there was nothing to amend, the RAPOC having gone, but it would be a new pleading particularising the claims in the re-amended Claim Form).  They needed to ask for permission to re-amend the Claim Form first as the RRAPOC did not particularise the claims as set out in the Amended Claim Form, which were all predicated on King Sturge having been dishonest or otherwise deliberately committing a wrong.  If the new claims had been permitted to be added to the Claim Form, then I do not see any difficulty in the Court giving the Claimants the opportunity to particularise them by serving the RRAPOC.  The real question in my view therefore was whether the Claimants should be permitted to re-amend the Amended Claim Form by adding or substituting what were accepted to be new claims. </p>

There were I think two strands to Mr Onslow’s argument here.  The first was that one cannot compare the new claims with the claims in the Claim Form alone, as this did not tell you enough about the facts.  He pointed out that CPR r 16.2(1)(a) and (b) only require the claim form to contain a concise statement of the nature of the claim and to specify the remedy which the claimant seeks, whereas CPR r 16.4(1)(a) requires the particulars of claim to include a concise statement of the <span style="font-style:italic">facts</span> on which the claimant relies.  That is reflected in the prescribed form of claim form (Form N1) which has a space for “Brief Details of the Claim”, whereas the very purpose of the particulars is to particularise the claims.  Mr Onslow, in answer to a question from Arnold LJ, confirmed that his case was that it followed that one could never use the claim form as the comparator for the comparative exercise required by CPR r 17.4(2).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this, for two reasons.  The first is that although the details of the claim that a claimant has to include in the claim form can be brief, there is a certain minimum that every claimant has to include, and claimants can – and many do, including the Claimants in the present case – go rather beyond the minimum if they want to.  Mr Onslow referred us to the decision of Akenhead J in <span style="font-style:italic">Travis Perkins Trading Co Ltd v Caerphilly County Borough Council </span>[2014] EWHC 1498 (TCC) </p>

But Akenhead J also cited from the judgment of Cooke J in <span style="font-style:italic">Nomura International plc v Granada Group Ltd </span>[2007] EWHC 642 (Comm) where at [39] he had said that because of the similarity of the terms of the rule and because the underlying policy must be the same, reference could be made to authorities on the equivalent rule in the RSC (Ord 6 r 2), one of which was <span style="font-style:italic">Marshall v London Passenger Transport Board </span>[1936] 3 AER 83; and in that case (cited by Akenhead J at [21]) Romer LJ had said that the plaintiff must give the defendants some general idea of the nature of his claim, and that it was not sufficient for the plaintiff to indorse his writ merely with a claim for damages, or damages for breach of contract or negligence, but he had to give some indication of the contract said to be broken, or the duty which the defendants were said to have failed to perform.  I accept therefore that a claimant does not need to put very much in the way of details in the claim form (although he can add more if he wants to), but there is a certain minimum that he needs to state.  There will therefore always be facts stated in the claim form, even if they are quite exiguous.  In the present case as I have said they are in fact quite detailed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But the more compelling reason why I consider that the comparison required by CPR r 17.4(2) can be done with the claim form alone is that there are circumstances where this is all that is available.  A claim form is a <span style="font-style:italic">“statement of case”</span> within the meaning of the CPR: see the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">“statement of case”</span> in CPR r 2.3.  The claimant can therefore amend it under Part 17 which permits amendments to statements of case.  That includes CPR r 17.1(1) by which a party may amend his statement of case before it has been served on any other party; such an amendment does not need permission, but may be retrospectively disallowed by the Court under CPR r 17.2.  Suppose the claimant issues a claim form, as claimants frequently do, right at the end of the limitation period.  The claimant then has four months before he has to serve it (CPR r 7.5).  It follows that if the claimant wishes to, he can add a new claim to his claim form in those four months prior to service and does not need prior permission to do so.  But if the new claim is, or arguably is, statute-barred at the time of the amendment, the defendant can, once it has been served, challenge that under CPR r 17.2, and the Court will have to consider whether it could have been permitted under CPR 17.4(2).  That will require the comparative exercise to be done, and if, as may well be the case, no particulars of claim have yet been served, that will have to be done by reference to whatever has been pleaded by way of brief details in the claim form.  That may, depending on how detailed the claimant has chosen to be, be a difficult exercise but since the onus is on the claimant that is to some extent his own responsibility; on the other hand it may be a very simple one even if the details are the irreducible minimum.  Suppose for example a claimant brings a claim for professional negligence against a solicitor, and then amends the claim form before service by adding a new claim for fraud.  That, on the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">Paragon Finance plc v D B Thakerar &amp; Co </span>[1999] 1 AER 400, would be a new claim that on any view did not arise out of the same facts, and if statute-barred, or arguably so, would fall to be disallowed under CPR r 17.2 and r 17.4(2) however brief the details of the claim. </p>

I have some reservations about this as normally a document has a single meaning when first executed, or at least communicated, and cannot change its meaning in the light of later developments; and I have quite serious reservations about the use Akenhead J made of the principle.  In that case the claim form had been issued on 26 July 2013 (see at [8]); the date when the claim form was served does not appear to be given in the judgment, unless I have missed it, but must have been shortly afterwards as on 2 August 2013 the parties agreed a stay (see at [12]), which would not have been necessary had the proceedings not yet been served; and after various extensions of time had been agreed the particulars of claim were not served until early November 2013 (see at [13]).  Nevertheless Akenhead J concluded at [27] that because the parties had agreed to the extension of time, the Court could have regard to the particulars of claim as an aid to interpretation of the claim form served some three months before.  That seems doubtful to me, particularly so when the whole question was whether the particulars of claim went beyond the claims advanced in the claim form. </p>

One of the things that is crystal clear is that HHJ Barker intended on 23 October 2018 to strike out the entirety of the RAPOC then and there, not only as against King Sturge but as against the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants as well.  That is understandable since he had just delivered a judgment holding that <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> the claims in the RAPOC, both as against King Sturge and the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants, had no reasonable prospect of success, and in those circumstances I find it difficult to see how he could properly have allowed any of them to remain on the pleadings.   Yet this is the effect of the proposed variation – I decline to call it a correction since to my mind it is not.  In those circumstances I do not see that we have any business varying the October 2018 Order which did what the Judge intended it to do and was certainly <span style="font-style:italic">an</span> appropriate order for him to make in the circumstances, if not the only appropriate order.  If anything, it is the Appellants who to my mind might have had an argument for suggesting that he should have gone further and struck out the Claim Form as well; but they did not do that and that question is not before us.   There is certainly in my view no warrant for rewriting his Order so drastically as to convert the striking out of the RAPOC from an immediate and final striking out into a contingent striking out conditional on the Claimants failing to apply to amend and put up security.  That does not seem to me either a proper use of the power to vary in CPR r 3.1(7) or within the slip rule in CPR r 40.12. </p>

The rule was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co v Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals Inc (No 2)</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 414.  There the trial judge had ordered an unsuccessful claimant to pay the costs of the two defendants, but had limited the defendants to one set of costs between them from a certain date.  On appeal the Court of Appeal held that that was wrong, and that both defendants should have their costs of trial without such limitation, and substituted an order to that effect.  The consequence was that interest on costs ceased to run from the date of the trial judge’s order and only ran from the date of the Court of Appeal’s order.  Aldous LJ referred to various authorities which drew a distinction between having second thoughts or intentions (where the rule cannot be invoked) and giving true effect to the Court’s first thoughts and intentions (where it can): see at [22]-[25].  In the case before them the only issue raised on the costs appeal was whether the defendants should or should not be restricted to one set of costs, and all that the Court of Appeal had intended to do was to remove that restriction and not alter the general right to costs under the judge’s order (see at [26]).  The Court of Appeal’s order could therefore be corrected to give effect to that intention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A number of other points emerge from that case.

That is a familiar principle from the law of rectification, which seems to me to share a number of features with the slip rule: in each case the jurisdiction can be invoked to correct a written expression which does not give effect to the actual first thoughts of the person concerned, but cannot be invoked to give effect to second thoughts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A second point is that the rule cannot be invoked if all that has happened is that a judge has misunderstood or misappreciated the law; that can only be corrected by appeal.  See per Aldous LJ at [22] citing a statement to that effect by Sir John Donaldson MR from <span style="font-style:italic">Mutual Shipping</span> at 193.  Again that seems to me to be similar to the law of rectification.  If for example A intends to transfer a property to B and executes such a transfer, he cannot obtain rectification by asserting that although he did intend to execute the transfer he thought wrongly that certain tax consequences would follow and would not have done it that way had he appreciated what the actual tax consequences were.     </p>

There is no question of any clerical error.  Nor is there to my mind the slightest doubt that this is precisely what HHJ Barker intended to do.

His October 2018 Order provided for it at paragraph 3.1 in clear and unequivocal terms.  To change that now to provide that the RAPOC should not be struck out unless the Claimants failed to apply to amend and put up security would not be to give effect to his first thoughts; it would not in fact even be to give effect to his second thoughts as he was never asked to consider changing his Order in this way and we do not know what his reaction would have been. </p>

I think he was right to make that amendment, as the post-judgment discussions on 23 October 2018 leave it rather unclear whether HHJ Barker actually had limitation in mind.  What he himself referred to were two considerations: one was that allowing the Claimants to continue without starting again would avoid the need to pay a second £10,000 issue fee (although he recognised that that would not break the bank of the Claimants); the other was that he did not want to put the Claimants in the position of facing an abuse of process argument of the “could and should have brought it before” type (that is under the so-called rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100).

But the Judge does not appear to have picked this up in the further discussions, and certainly did not mention limitation in his short Ruling.  On the other hand it is fair to say that when he came to give the 2020 Judgment, he said (at [75]) that the whole point of paragraph 3 of the October 2018 Order was to <span style="font-style:italic">“permit the Claimants an opportunity to reformulate a claim focussed primarily against the [2</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to 7</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic">] Defendants and not [King Sturge] because of, and therefore based on, the facts then pleaded.”</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is for two reasons.  The first, which is probably the more important one, is that the October 2018 Order, by deliberately keeping the Amended Claim Form alive, did give the Claimants an opportunity to bring themselves within CPR r 17.4(2).  As I have sought to explain, that in my view enabled the Claimants to bring forward any new claims which could survive a comparison with the matters pleaded in the Amended Claim Form.  It is true that on the view I take it did not enable the Claimants to rely on the facts and claims pleaded in the RAPOC, all of which had been struck out, but only on the matters pleaded in the Amended Claim Form, but that was the effect of keeping the Amended Claim Form alive but not the RAPOC.  HHJ Barker was himself rather doubtful whether this would prove to be of any use to the Claimants – he referred in the post-judgment discussions to the possibility that there might not be <span style="font-style:italic">“a legal way through the thickets”</span> and that the fact that the conspiracy claim was predicated solely on the deceit claim <span style="font-style:italic">“may prove to be an insuperable obstacle”</span>.  So he was not holding out any great prospect of the Claimants being able to find a way to plead their new claims – he was just giving them the opportunity to do it if it could be done.  The fact that on the view I take they went about it the wrong way and failed to find a legal way through does not mean that he did not give them the opportunity he intended them to have, or in my view justify a re-writing of his Order.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, even if, which I have doubts about, HHJ Barker thought the effect of his Order would be to enable the Claimants to bring forward new claims by comparing them with the claims in the RAPOC which he had struck out, he was in my view for the reasons I have given under a misapprehension.  But that does not mean that the October 2018 Order did not do what he intended it to do, which was to strike out the currently pleaded claims in the RAPOC but keep the Claim Form (alone) alive; it means that the consequences in law of doing this were different from what (on this hypothesis) he thought they would be.  That is not something that I consider enables us to characterise the October 2018 Order as containing an accidental slip or omission, or entitles us to rewrite the Order under the guise of correction.  In my view CPR r 40.12 is simply not available in the circumstances of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He also adverted to a third type of case where there had been a manifest mistake in the formulation of the order, citing as an example <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v Golding</span> [2007] EWCA Civ 416.  In that case the Master had made an order joining a third defendant into a libel action where the claim could no longer be pursued either against the first defendant (who could not be found and had never been served) or against the second defendant as the claim had been discontinued against him.  That meant the order was misconceived, and led to the Master making an order that he had no power to make: see per Buxton LJ at [6], [26].  The Master also made a mistake as to the effect of his order, which he had intended to keep the issue of limitation alive for the benefit of the third defendant but which had in fact failed to do so.  The Judge had decided that this fundamental error entitled him to set the Order aside pursuant to CPR r 3.1(7), and Buxton LJ held at [26] that that was open to him.  On analysis this is not simply a case where CPR r 3.1(7) was invoked because an order did not have the same effect as intended, but where it was entirely misconceived both because there was no power to make it at all and because it did not achieve what it was meant to.  I do not think it justifies the invocation of CPR r 3.1(7) simply on the basis that an order that does what it was intended to do has consequences that are not fully foreseen.  In my judgment this is not an appropriate case for the principled exercise of the discretion in CPR r 3.1(7) at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But let me assume I am wrong about that and that this is, contrary to my view, an appropriate case to re-consider the question of what order should have been made on 23 October 2018.  In that case, I still do not see that it would be right to make the striking out of the RAPOC conditional on the Claimants failing to apply to amend or put up security.  On 29 March 2018 the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> to 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Defendants applied to strike out the claims on the basis that they all depended on King Sturge being found to have acted dishonestly or have committed other deliberate wrongdoing, and that such a case was unsustainable.  That gave the Claimants, as I have pointed out above, ample time to consider, before their existing claims were struck out, whether they wished to plead any further claims in the alternative.  On 23 October 2018 having heard full argument the Judge held that the claims were indeed unsustainable and struck them out unconditionally.  I do not see that it can possibly be said that he was wrong to do so.  Indeed I have real doubts whether having reached the conclusion he did, he could properly have done anything else than strike out the RAPOC.  Although CPR r 3.4(a) confers a discretion on the Court, it would be a very unusual step for a judge to decline to strike out, or grant summary judgment on, a claim that he had held to be hopeless.  On what principled basis could he properly do that?  It does not seem to me to be a good reason for refusing to strike out a claim that has been held to be unsustainable that it is desired to keep it artificially alive on the pleadings so as to allow the claimant not to litigate that claim but to bring another one.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There was some suggestion that this was to take an overly-technical view and that it was unjust to the Claimants who the Judge thought did have claims with real prospects of success against the current Defendants.  My response is that limitation frequently turns on the application of hard-edged rules which do not allow room for any discretion: if a claim form is issued one day late the claim fails, however strong; if issued one day in time, it can go forward even if demonstrably weak.  Here the hard-edged rule is that if a claimant wishes to add a new claim after the limitation period has expired on the basis that it arises out of the same facts as his existing claim, he has to do that before, and not after, his existing claim has been disposed of.  The Claimants in fact had not one but two opportunities to try and get their alternative claims on the pleadings: they could have applied to add them before their existing claims were struck out, which they did not do.  And because of the order made by the Judge, which was unusually generous to them, they were given a second opportunity by the Amended Claim Form being kept alive, although that, for the reasons I have given, required them in my view to justify their new claims by comparison with the Amended Claim Form, not with the claims in the RAPOC which had been struck out.  It is not at all clear that they could have justified their new claims on that basis, but the Judge never purported to guarantee that they would be able to, and they did have the opportunity to try.  That seems to me enough to satisfy the requirements of justice to the Claimants.      </p>

It did not accurately reflect the reasoning in the 2018 Judgment because that reasoning was, as I have demonstrated, based on summary judgment, not striking out. It was internally inconsistent because it both gave permission to re-amend the Particulars of Claim (paragraph 1) and struck the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim out (paragraph 3.1): if the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim were strikable, then permission to reamend should not have been granted. It was also internally inconsistent because it struck out the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim and dismissed the claims in them (paragraph 3.1), but also gave the Claimants the opportunity to apply to amend the claim form and to “advance further amended Particulars of Claim”, i.e. to re-re-amend the Particulars of Claim (paragraph 3.2): if the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim were struck out, then there was nothing to re-re-amend. It was procedurally incoherent because it stayed the striking out of the claim form and the dismissal of the action against the Second to Seventh Defendants (paragraph 3.3(i)) when no stay was required since no immediate order striking out the claim form and dismissing the action was made against the Second to Seventh Defendants, but only an unless order (paragraph 3.2). Further confusion is caused by the use, in apparent contradistinction, of the terms “action” and “claims”.

The Second to Seventh Defendants have been refused permission to appeal against those conclusions.

That is a clear statement from the judge as to what his intention had been, and thus as to why, as a matter of substance not form, the Claimants should be permitted to re-re-amend the Particulars of Claim to advance the new claims if the rule 17.4(2) test was satisfied.   </p>

First, as Nugee LJ has explained in paragraph 59 above, this contention is inconsistent with paragraph 3.2 of the October 2018 Order, which expressly permitted the Claimants to apply to re-amend the Claim Form. Secondly, it is not only a contention which was not advanced before the judge, but also it is inconsistent with the way in which the matter was argued before the judge, which was to compare the facts alleged in the draft Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim with those alleged in the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim: see the 2020 Judgment at [67][78]. Thirdly, it is not a contention in relation to which the Second to Seventh Defendants have permission to appeal.

I do not accept this. The Claimants did not make such an application because the Second to Seventh Defendants’ jurisdictional formulation of their argument based on section 35(5) was not raised until after the judge had given the 2020 Judgment. It only became necessary for the Claimants to make such an application once the Second to Seventh Defendants raised, and obtained permission to appeal on, this ground. In any event, this Court has all the powers of the court below. If the court below should have corrected or varied the First Order, then this Court can do so. Although counsel for the Second to Seventh Defendants submitted that the Second to Seventh Defendants had been prejudiced as a result of the point only being raised for the first time in the Respondents’ notice, he failed to substantiate that submission. It is true that, as he pointed out, the Claimants were refused permission to appeal against the October 2018 Order, but that is irrelevant because the present application is not to challenge the substance of the order, but to correct or vary its wording so as to conform to the judge’s intention. </p>

In my view, however, it is also clear from the 2018 Judgment. As I have explained, it is clear from the 2018 Judgment that the judge intended to give the Claimants the chance to apply to re-reamend the Particulars of Claim to plead viable claims against the Second to Seventh Defendants. Furthermore, he made an order paragraph 3.2 of which expressly permitted the Claimants to apply to re-re-amend the Particulars of Claim. True it is that the judge also expressed an intention to strike out the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, and made an order in paragraph 3.1 giving effect to that expressed intention, but it is clear that he did not in his short extempore ruling think through the contradiction between that expressed intention and the intention manifested by the 2018 Judgment and given effect to in paragraph 3.2.

The judge’s adjudicated and manifest intention in his 2018 Judgment was to permit the Claimants to try to reformulate their claims against the Second to Seventh Defendants, but not to pre-empt any issue which might then arise as to limitation. He did not realise that the effect of making an order in the form in which he did would not permit the realisation of that intention. Accordingly, the order should be varied in a manner which does permit the realisation of that intention. </p>

It is therefore not open to the Second to Seventh Defendants to contend that the judge should not have given the Claimants a final chance to re-re-amend the Particulars of Claim to plead viable claims against them, but should have granted summary judgment finally dismissing the case against them, which is what I understand Nugee LJ to be saying in paragraph 87 above. Moreover, it is not unusual for judges dealing with summary judgment and/or strike out applications who can see that it may be possible for claimants to reformulate their case to advance viable claims to give the claimants a final opportunity to do so.       </p>

That chronological sequence is what opens up the argument, which we have held is entitled to succeed in the form of Ground 7 of the appeal.  That argument is that, contrary to the judge’s intention, none of the facts alleged in the RAPOC can form the basis of an application to amend.  Yet, if the chronology of the order had been reversed and the pleading left intact until the new claim had been added by amendment, or if the striking out of the particulars of claim had been made to occur only if a satisfactory amendment was not formulated, no such problem would have arisen.  That analysis suggests that the IG Defendants’ success on Ground 7 lies more in an accident arising out of the form of order rather than in any inherent merit. </p>

In layman’s terms, the case against King Sturge was dead, but that against the remaining defendants was not, and might survive.  That was because, even if the case of deceit by King Sturge was put to one side, there remained concerns about the conduct of the remaining defendants which were sufficient to justify allowing the Claimants an opportunity to amend.

He described this opportunity as “wafer thin”: I regard this submission as completely unrealistic and illusory.  I accept that it is possible, at least in theory, for the court, in a limitation case, to require a claimant to re-plead his case solely in reliance on the skeletal details in the claim form.  A claim form is a statement of case, and may allege rudimentary facts which remain in issue despite the demise of the particulars of claim.  The question for us, however, is whether it is realistic to suppose that this is what the judge had in mind in the circumstances of the present case.  Given what I have said so far, and the complexity of the case which it was plainly contemplated would be brought against the Second to Seventh Defendants, it seems to me that it is inconceivable that the judge had in mind a possible amendment based only on the facts pleaded in the Claim Form.  </p>

There was no attempt to explain why those words mattered.  As the judge later observed, the case before him was argued on the basis of Rule 17.4 and not on the language of section 35.

I entirely agree with him that there is “not the slightest doubt” that HHJ Barker intended to strike out the RAPOC.  The reason he had that intention was that, based as they were on the deceit of King Sturge, they did not disclose reasonable grounds for bringing a claim.  His remarks about the RAPOC not proceeding further, or surviving, must be understood in that context.  In making those remarks the judge was not dealing with the mechanics of precisely when the striking out would take effect, or the precise point at which the facts pleaded in that statement of case would cease to be available to formulate an amended claim.  In my view, it is clear that he did not intend to remove the RAPOC from the picture when it came to formulating an amended claim against the remaining defendants.  On the contrary, it is clear that he intended the RAPOC to provide the basis for such a claim. </p>
