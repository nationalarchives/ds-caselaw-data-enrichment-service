	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">According to Federico, he wished (and wishes) to use the €12 million to pursue a business opportunity. “The main idea,” he said in a witness statement dated 26 March 2020, “is to produce spirits with tailored flavours that can meet the standard of different markets by, first producing the desired aromatic compounds in the fermented wine and then to separate them with extreme precision and to blend them subsequently into the final product”. Federico prepared a business plan for OGSL in, it seems, September 2019 and he explained in his witness statement that he had “pretty much followed my business plan although I have changed a few points to increase production and profitability”. He also detailed expenditure which OGSL had undertaken to date. In total, he said, some €1.6 million had been spent on setting up a plant and purchasing machinery. The outlay had largely been on the purchase of three warehouse units in Kent, but there had also been expenditure (often by way of deposit) on items such as distillation columns, fermenters, a yeast inoculator, a centrifuge and storage and buffer tanks. OGSL had further paid a deposit to enable it to participate in a food fair that was scheduled to take place in November 2020. </p>

Since then, Nueva has issued proceedings against OGSL in Spain challenging the validity of the loan contract. It alleges that Michele did not have authority to enter into the contract, that the contract required approval from Nueva’s shareholders, that Michele acted in bad faith and that the contract lacked “causa”. It is common ground that under Spanish law the claim is not proprietary in nature. </p>

The matter came before Nugee J on 16 March on a without notice basis. He acceded to the application, granting an injunction until 30 March, but it was stated in the order that it did not prohibit OGSL from dealing with or disposing of any of its assets in the “ordinary and proper course of business” and Nugee J explained in his judgment that the order was not intended to prevent expenditure on the business Federico was seeking to develop. In the course of his judgment, Nugee J said the following: </p>

I should make it clear that I do not regard spending money on developing a start-up business, if that is genuinely what is being done, as dissipation, and I do not think there is anything in the point that because it is a start-up it cannot be said to have an ordinary course of business. There is effectively here a fairly stark choice between whether this is a genuine attempt to finance a business to be run by Federico along the lines that the business plan suggests, in which case I think that such matters as buying warehouses, buying distilling equipment, spending money on marketing, setting up a website and getting the business up and running cannot be characterised as dissipation. Dissipation, as I understand it, means – this is not a definition but a paraphrase of what is found in the authorities – an unjustified removal or disposing of your assets in order to avoid (or with the effect of avoiding) a judgment debt. </p>

The intention behind it is to stop the reaction to being sued in Spain being one of taking any cash assets that are still available to Organic Grape and moving them in such a way as to make them more difficult to recover in the event that the claim is successful. It is not intended to strangle at an early stage this new start-up business which, if it is a genuine business, is entitled to pursue its business in the way that it wants to without the court stopping it.” </p>

The judge reckoned that the second-hand value of OGSL’s equipment would be less than its purchase cost and that its improvements to the warehouses were “specialist” and so unlikely to add value to the premises. Accordingly, “there will immediately be a depletion of the respondent’s assets if there is no Freezing Order” (paragraph 37). Turning to OGSL’s “intended business”, the Judge said that he was “not in a position to assess its prospects of success but there are certainly question marks about those prospects” and that, while he was “not in a position to say what the situation is here”, “there must be, certainly in the language of risk, a real risk that the business may fail” (paragraph 38).

A regulated investment company which acquires and sells shares and other securities on behalf of its clients would be treated in the same way. But we do not consider that the concept of the ordinary course of business would, as a general rule, comprehend alterations in investments by a private investor however wealthy he may be.

Nor again is the Court’s task to try to balance the risk of harm to the claimant if no freezing order is granted against that to the defendant if an order is made. Where something is in the ordinary course of a defendant’s business, he is allowed to pursue it even if it carries substantial risk (<span style="font-style:italic">Perry v Princess International Sales &amp; Services Ltd</span>), without consideration of whether it is reasonable (<span style="font-style:italic">Halifax plc v Chandler</span>) and without a balancing exercise being undertaken (<span style="font-style:italic">Halifax plc v Chandler</span>).

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.84in">45 And, to the extent that the touchstone of the jurisdiction is an abuse of the defendant’s power of disposition, I would hold that the investment of a defendant’s sole remaining significant asset in a speculative venture at a time when it is facing a significant claim for an amount which exceeds the defendant’s available funds, which has been found to be seriously arguable, in circumstances where there are no other creditors or obligation on the defendant, is indeed an abuse of the power of dispossession. In this respect the case is far removed and distinguishable from a case in which it is proposed to use funds to pay creditors or employees or even in the course of an ongoing existing business. Rather, this proposal involves putting funds which are currently safe in jeopardy, in a speculative venture. Though the analogy is not perfect, support for this view can be drawn from the cases that hold that a person who, being about to embark on a speculative venture, alienates his or her assets to an associate, thereby defrauds creditors <marker name="tab"/>within <marker name="tab"/>the <marker name="tab"/>meaning <marker name="tab"/>of <marker name="tab"/>the <span style="font-style:italic">Conveyancing Act</span> 1919 (NSW), s37A and the <span style="font-style:italic">Bankruptcy Ac</span>t 1966 (Cth), s 121: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte Russell; Re Butterworth</span> (1882) 19 Ch D 588, particularly in the judgment of Lord Jessel MR, who said: ‘The principle is that a man is not entitled to go into a hazardous business, and immediately before doing so settle all his property voluntarily, the object being this: “If I succeed in business, I make a fortune for myself.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It will be apparent from what I have already said that I do not consider Brereton J’s approach to accord with the law of England and Wales. It does not in my view “suffice to establish that there is a real risk that the defendant will deal with the assets in a manner calculated, or liable, to produce the result that a judgment in the favour of the plaintiff would not be satisfied”. Further, I do not think that cases dealing with transactions defrauding creditors are of any help. For a transaction to be vulnerable as one defrauding creditors under the current provision, section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986, it must both be “at an undervalue” and “entered into … for the purpose (a) of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may at some time make, a claim against him, or (b) of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which he is making or may make”. In a case such as I am postulating, in contrast, the defendant is not proposing to enter into a transaction at an undervalue and is not aiming to prejudice the interests of a claimant. </p>

OGSL may wish to set up a business and have taken preliminary steps in that regard, but no business has thus far been established. The company has no employees and its warehouse premises are empty. Not only has it not produced anything, but it has not even acquired the means to do so. For a company to have an “ordinary” course of trading, there must be a pattern of previous conduct against which transactions can be judged.

The better view, I think, is that a defendant in OGSL’s position, which has not established a pattern of <span style="font-style:italic">trading</span>, cannot simply rely on the “ordinary and proper business” exception to a freezing order but must specifically ask the Court to authorise pursuit of its fledgling business.

The Judge did not suggest that OGSL was acting in bad faith or seeking to pursue its venture with the object of putting its assets beyond reach. In fact, not only was there no finding of impropriety, but Nueva had not claimed that there was anything improper about OGSL’s plans. It was evidently fundamental to the Judge’s decision that the business had risk attached to it. He saw as “good sense” <span style="font-style:italic">Harrison Partners Construction Pty Ltd v Jevena Pty Ltd</span> where Brereton J said that it would “suffice to establish that there is a real risk that the defendant will deal with the assets in a manner calculated, or liable, to produce the result that a judgment in the favour of the plaintiff would not be satisfied” and, as regards the case before him, the Judge said that there were “certainly question marks” about OGSL’s prospects, that there must be “a real risk that the business might fail”, that “it is proper to call the business speculative” and that “expending what remains of the €12 million on developing this business runs a substantial risk that the assets will be significantly reduced”. However, the Judge did not find that the business had no reasonable prospect of success nor even that its chances of success were poor. To the contrary, he considered that he was “not in a position” to assess the prospects of </p>

As I have said earlier in this judgment, I do not think that a business should be prohibited merely because it carries even a substantial degree of risk and I do not see the <span style="font-style:italic">Harrison </span>case as representing the law in this jurisdiction. “Question marks”, “real risk” and the fact that the business could be described as “speculative” do not provide adequate reasons for preventing trading. </p>
