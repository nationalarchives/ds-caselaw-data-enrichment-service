	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These conjoined appeals raise two points of general importance as to procedural aspects of applications in insolvency proceedings, and one point of no general significance.  They arise out of the bankruptcy of Mrs Nicola Jane Ide who was made bankrupt on her own petition on 6 December 2012.  The respondents in this Court, Ms Sarah Bell and Mr Paul Williams, are the current joint trustees in bankruptcy of Mrs Ide (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the Trustees”</span>) and brought an application in the County Court against a number of respondents, including the present appellants, HH Aluminium &amp; Building Products Ltd (<span style="font-weight:bold">“HH”</span>) and Mr Peter House, who were 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> respondents to that application.  Mr House is a director of HH.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first issue is whether it is possible for the County Court to transfer part (only) of insolvency proceedings to the High Court.  On 4 February 2020 HHJ Matthews, sitting in the County Court at Bristol, decided that the answer was Yes, and by his Order of that date transferred to the High Court (also in Bristol) an application made by HH and Mr House to strike out, or grant summary judgment on, the Trustees’ application against them.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Having transferred HH’s and Mr House’s application from the County Court to the High Court, HHJ Matthews proceeded to hear it himself sitting as a Judge of the High Court.  The second issue arises out of his substantive decision, given in a judgment dated 12 February 2020.  This is whether the same principles apply to an extension of time for service of an insolvency application as apply to the extension of time for service of a claim form under the CPR.  In the latter case it is well established that where a claim form has been issued, but not served, within the limitation period, an extension of time for service should not, save in exceptional circumstances, be granted as that would be to deprive the defendant of a limitation defence.  That was applied to the case of an application in insolvency proceedings by HHJ WaldenSmith, also sitting as a Judge of the High Court, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kelcrown Homes Ltd </span>[2017] EWHC 537 (Ch) (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">“Kelcrown”</span>).  In the present case HHJ Matthews declined to follow <span style="font-style:italic">Kelcrown</span>, holding that the vacating and re-fixing of the first hearing of the application had the practical effect of extending time for service, and that there was no need to have regard to limitation considerations in the same way as there would have been under the CPR.  By his Order dated 12 February 2020 he therefore dismissed HH’s and Mr House’s application to strike out the Trustees’ application for failure to serve in time.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third issue is whether HHJ Matthews was wrong to decline to grant summary judgment in favour of Mr House on the Trustees’ claim against him.  This raises no issue of general importance and turns on the application of well established principles to the particular facts of this case.   </p>

HH and Mr House now appeal both decisions.  </p>

These were (1) Mrs Ide; (2) her husband Mr Ide; (3) Mr Alexander Burnett; (4) HH; (5) Mr House; and (6) Mrs Ide’s father, Mr George Webb.  The application sought relief in respect of various payments made directly or indirectly by Mrs Ide to the respondents before her bankruptcy which were said to have been transactions at an undervalue, preferences or transactions defrauding creditors.  It is not necessary to refer to the basis for those claims in any detail but in brief summary they all stemmed from the fact that Mrs Ide had sold a property known as Ortus House in Lyndhurst, Hampshire in April 2012.  She received net proceeds of sale of over £840,000, and on 11 April 2012 made two payments, one of £350,000 to Mr Burnett and one of £485,000 to HH.  HH had retained some of the money for itself but also made various payments to, or for the benefit of, Mr Ide, Mr Webb and (possibly) Mr House.   </p>

It was then too late to pay the court fee and the Trustees’ solicitors paid it on the morning of 31 January 2019.  It was common ground that it was issued, or at least arguably issued, on the last day of the limitation period, on the basis that time ran from the appointment of trustees in bankruptcy; we were not addressed on the effect, if any, of the court fee not being paid until the next day.

That was in accordance with para 3.6 of the Practice Direction (Insolvency Proceedings) dated 4 July 2018 and issued by Sir Geoffrey Vos C with the approval of the Lord Chancellor (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the Insolvency PD”</span>).  After transfer to the County Court at Bristol the application notice was, on or about 29 April 2019, endorsed by the Court by filling in the textbox with a hearing date and time of 9 July 2019 at 11 am, and in May 2019 it was returned so endorsed to the Trustees’ solicitors.  That hearing, being the first hearing of the substantive application, would have been a short directions hearing.     </p>

That application (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the June application”</span>) was made without notice to any of the respondents (and the application notice said that it was not intended to serve anyone with it).  It sought a number of things.  The first two concerned service out of the jurisdiction, and substituted service, on Mr Burnett who was running a bar in Montserrat; the third the amendment of the application notice for the substantive application by correcting a couple of errors.  The fourth sought an order that the hearing fixed for 11 am on 9 July 2019 be vacated and re-listed for the first available date after 1 October 2019.  The witness statement in support (from Ms Karen Unsworth of the Trustees’ solicitors) made it clear that the substantive application had not yet been served on any of the respondents and said that it was intended to serve all the respondents at the same time once the June application had been determined. </p>

HHJ Matthews however disagreed.

There is no doubt therefore that bankruptcy proceedings are “insolvency proceedings” and within the scope of the 2016 rules.  But equally Part IX includes within it provisions such as s. 339 and s. 340 under which the trustee can apply to court (in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences respectively).  So if “insolvency proceedings” is given the wider interpretation, applications under s. 339 and s. 340, being proceedings in respect of Part IX IA 1986, would equally be insolvency proceedings within the scope of the 2016 rules.

The regulation referred to is Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings.  Art 2(4) contains a definition of “insolvency proceedings” for the purposes of the regulation: it means the proceedings listed in Annex A.  This lists a number of different types of insolvency proceedings for each Member State described in general terms: those for the UK for example include winding up, administration and bankruptcy.  But the primary purpose of the regulation is to allocate jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings to the Member State where the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated and to provide that insolvency proceedings opened in other Member States are secondary proceedings with limited effect (Art 3).  It is not surprising therefore that the Annex lists specific types of proceedings that can be regarded as opening a particular insolvency regime.  That seems to me to cast no light on the meaning of “insolvency proceedings” in the 2016 rules, which on any view is wider than the meaning in the regulation: Mr Fennell, who appeared for the Trustees, gave the example of receivership.  Receivership is not one of the insolvency proceedings listed in the regulation.  But IA 1986 contains (in </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Powers said that that suggested that a transfer could only be made of the entire proceedings (the bankruptcy proceedings as a whole) as it would not make sense to have to deliver the whole file to the transferee court if only a particular application was being transferred.  But that depends on what “proceedings” means in rule 12.33(1).  If it means the entire proceedings, then no doubt the “file of the proceedings” is the entire file of the bankruptcy and all the applications made in it.  But if rule 12.30 permits transfer of a particular application, then those are the proceedings referred to in rule 12.33(1), and the “file of the proceedings” can quite reasonably be interpreted as limited to the file relating to that particular application, as indeed Ms Powers accepted.  On analysis therefore this does not help to answer whether “proceedings” is to be given a narrow or wide interpretation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Powers also sought to derive some support from rule 12.33(2) on the basis that it would seem unnecessary, and increase costs and run the risk of confusion, if the official receiver had to be notified every time a particular application was transferred.  I do not think that any particular weight can be placed on that point: we were told by Mr Fennell that even after trustees had been appointed, official receivers had some residual functions to perform in a bankruptcy and there does not seem anything surprising in them being notified whenever proceedings in a bankruptcy are transferred.  If the transfer is limited to a particular application, the notification will no doubt say so and unless the official receiver had any particular interest in that application, there would be no reason for him or her to do anything.  But I do not see that it would be confusing, and the cost (which would appear to fall on the Court anyway) would be minimal.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Powers also sought to rely on the High Court decisions under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 and Bankruptcy Rules 1952, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kouyoumdjian </span>[1956] 1 WLR 558 and <span style="font-style:italic">Re A Debtor </span>[1985] 1 WLR 6, on the principle that where a subject has been dealt with by a developing series of Acts, the Courts often find it necessary, in construing the latest Act (or here rules) to trace the course of the development: see <span style="font-style:italic">Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</span> (7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edn, 2017) at §24.5.  But I do not consider that those cases are of any assistance either.  First, they were decisions on differently worded provisions.  Second, it was established, very shortly after the IA 1986 and its accompanying rules (the Insolvency Rules 1986) were introduced, that they formed a new code which was in general to be interpreted without reference to the previous law.  A comparatively recent statement to that effect can be found in the judgment of Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in administration)</span> [2017] UKSC 38 at [12] where he referred to the 1986 legislation as representing a “comprehensive overhaul” of the insolvency legislation and said that it cannot be assumed that judicial decisions relating to previous insolvency legislation necessarily hold good in relation to the 1986 legislation; but the principle was well established long before that.  In the light of that I do not consider that the interpretation of rule 12.30(2) of the 2016 rules should be governed, or even influenced, by the decisions on predecessor legislation in different terms. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">We are left therefore to make sense of the rule as it stands.  As a matter of language, “proceedings” is one of those words that has a fluid meaning.  It can quite sensibly be used to mean the entirety of bankruptcy proceedings; but there is no reason why it cannot also be used to describe a discrete application within bankruptcy proceedings as a whole.  So the language of the rule does not provide any clear answer.  In those circumstances we should interpret the rule in such a way as to make most practical sense.  I agree with Mr Fennell that that points towards adopting the wide interpretation under which it is possible for the County Court to transfer a particular application in the bankruptcy to the High Court.  He gave as an example a case where a trustee in bankruptcy brings two applications in the bankruptcy, one complex and high-value that was suitable to be tried in the High Court (such as a claim to recover a preference) and one that was a straightforward low-value claim that was routine County Court work (such as a claim for possession and sale of the bankrupt’s house), where both applications are proceeding at the same time.  If the County Court could only transfer the whole bankruptcy, it would mean that either the High Court would have to deal with the low-value claim, or the County Court would have to deal with the high-value one, or the bankruptcy proceedings as a whole would have to be transferred back and forth every time another hearing in one of the applications loomed.  None of this makes any sense.  In my judgment it is more sensible to interpret rule 12.30(2) as enabling the County Court to transfer a particular application in bankruptcy without having to transfer the whole bankruptcy, and that is the meaning we should give it.   </p>

It also has the merit of being consistent with the Insolvency PD, para 3.6 of which clearly envisages that a transfer might be made either of an “application within existing insolvency proceedings” or of “the entirety of those insolvency proceedings”.  Ms Powers correctly pointed out that Practice Directions have no legislative force and if they misstate the law they “carry no authority at all” (<span style="font-style:italic">U v Liverpool City Council</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 475 at [48] per Brooke LJ) but it is nevertheless some reassurance to find that a Practice Direction issued by Sir Geoffrey Vos C takes the same view of the 2016 rules as I do. </p>

In the present case HHJ Matthews disagreed (at [16]) on the grounds that rule 12.8 does not refer to fixing a time at all.  That suggests that he was unfortunately not referred to the definition of “venue” in rule 1.2(2) (see paragraph 10 above), which makes it clear that the fixing of the “venue” under rule 12.8 requires the Court to fix a date, time and place; that is then the “venue” endorsed on the sealed copy which is referred to in rule 12.9(1), as provided for in the form used by the Trustees.   </p>

The other is to ensure the proper operation of limitation periods (§5.3).

That is true but to my mind is a point which goes the other way.  A potential defendant to a Part 7 claim will know, if well advised, that the claimant will usually have 6 years (or whatever the appropriate limitation period is) to issue, and a further 4 months to serve, a claim form, so in the ordinary case can assume that no claim is likely to be able to be brought if 6 years and 4 months have elapsed.  A potential respondent to an application in insolvency proceedings will not be able to calculate the period so nicely; but if rule 12.9(3) refers to the date first fixed for the hearing will at least be able to form some view of whether he is still at risk of proceedings, depending on how long the Court usually allows between issue and the date fixed for the first hearing.  But if rule 12.9(3) refers not to the date initially fixed but to a refixed date, and it is possible for the applicant to re-fix the date without reference to the respondent, the potential length of time for which the respondent remains at risk – as the present case illustrates – is even less predictable.   </p>

We did not receive detailed submissions on whether that could be done, as Mr Fennell suggested, as an administrative matter, or whether the moving of the date of a hearing, whether forwards or back, was, as Lewison LJ suggested, something that required a judicial decision.  One suspects that it is relatively unusual for the Court to be able to accommodate a hearing earlier than initially fixed.  But if this were to happen, it seems to me to be obvious that the applicant would have to notify the respondent both that the proceedings had been issued and of the hearing date, in order to make it an effective hearing.  That would be so regardless of what rule 12.9(3) means.  I do not therefore think that this example is a good reason to adopt an interpretation of rule 12.9(3) under which the effect of the applicant having a hearing moved to a later date is to put off the date for service of the application. </p>

I will say immediately that my instinct is that there is no reason why they should not, and every reason why they should.  Some applications in insolvency proceedings are more in the nature of applications for directions in which limitation periods either have no, or a much reduced, part to play.  But as the present case illustrates some insolvency applications are claims to recover money from the respondents and differ little in effect from claims under the CPR.  In each case the applicant or claimant seeks to prove certain allegations which entitle him to make a substantive claim against the respondent or defendant.  Indeed it was common ground that certain claims could be brought either by way of Part 7 claim or by application under the 2016 rules.  One example is a claim brought against a director for breach of fiduciary duty in relation to a company in liquidation.  That could be brought in the name of the company as a Part 7 claim alleging a breach of duty, or it could be brought by the liquidator as an application under s. 212 IA 1986 alleging a misfeasance, but the substance of the claim would be the same.  It is also common ground that limitation periods apply to applications in insolvency proceedings: see the interesting historical account by HHJ Matthews at [22]-[23].   </p>

A claim is brought within the relevant limitation period if it is issued within that period.  The claimant then has 4 months in which to serve it (or 6 months if it is to be served outside the jurisdiction).  That is the effect of CPR r 7.5 which provides that a claimant “must” complete the relevant step required by midnight on the calendar day 4 months after issue, the relevant step depending on the method of service adopted (for example posting in the case of service by first class post).  CPR r 7.6 permits the Court to extend time for service.  Neither rule says anything about limitation.

That usage may be influenced by the fact that, as Lewison LJ pointed out, under the RSC there was an express provision in RSC Ord 6 r 8 that a writ should be “valid” in the first instance for 12 months (or 4 months or whatever) so that it ceased to be valid if not served. </p>

Instead it simply provides (as already referred to) that the relevant step must be taken within 4 months.  Failure to do so does not totally invalidate the claim form, as the Court has power to grant an extension of time under CPR r 7.6.  I do not myself see any relevant difference between this and the 2016 rules which provide that an application notice “must” be served by a particular time.  That is again subject to the Court’s powers which include (by rule 12.9(3)(c)) a power to abridge the time limit, and more generally (by CPR r 3.1(2)(a), as incorporated by rule 12.1(1)) a power to extend time.  Mr Fennell expressly accepted that if an application notice was not served in time, and the Court refused to grant the necessary extension of time for service, then the application could not be proceeded with.

In each case an extension of time for service is needed from the Court if the proceedings are to continue.  In each case if the proceedings were brought within the limitation period but the limitation period has (or even arguably has) expired by the time the claimant or applicant applies for an extension, the effect of granting one would be to deprive (or arguably deprive) the defendant or respondent of a limitation defence.

I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the Order of DDJ Hebblethwaite as against HH and Mr House, with the consequence, if my Lords agree with me, that the claims against HH and Mr House cannot be proceeded with. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Two points have caused me some hesitation concerning ground 5. The first is a general one. As Nugee LJ has explained, the CPR provide a clear framework for considering the impact of limitation. Proceedings are commenced when the claim form is issued. Thus no limitation defence is available if the claim form is issued on the last day of the limitation period (six years from the accrual of the cause of action in most cases), but limitation will bar the claim if the claim form is issued a day later. If the claim form has been issued in time, it may be served on the last day of the period allowed for service (four months if within the jurisdiction, six months if outside). No extension of time for service will be granted if the limitation period has expired save in exceptional circumstances, and that is so even if the application is made prior to the expiry of the period permitted for service. The criterion for judging whether a claim is barred by limitation is equally applicable to insolvency applications, but the approach to applications for extensions of time for service cannot be applied without modification to the insolvency context because the Insolvency Rules 2016 do not specify any fixed period for service and, as Nugee LJ has explained, the date of the first hearing, and hence the date by which the application must be served, is determined by the court and not by the applicant. I agree with Nugee LJ that, for the reasons he has given, limitation considerations are just as relevant to insolvency applications as they are to claims under the CPR. Even so, it seems to me that an applicant which has issued its insolvency application on the last day of the limitation period and has only been given two months in which to serve it by the court stands in a different position when it comes to seeking an extension of time for service to an applicant which has issued its insolvency application on the last day of the limitation period and has been given four months in which to serve it by the court. If one takes the period specified by CPR rule 7.5 as the yardstick, and assuming that service is to be within the jurisdiction, then that would suggest that, other things being equal, the first applicant should be given a two-month extension of time whereas the second applicant should be refused an extension. In both cases, however, it would be relevant to consider what efforts the applicant had made to serve the application in time and why, therefore, the applicant needed an extension of time for service. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second point concerns the facts of the present case. It was common ground before HHJ Matthews, and this Court, that the substantive application by the Trustees was issued on 30 January 2019, and that that was at least arguably the last day of the limitation period. As Nugee LJ has explained, the court fixed a hearing date of 9 July </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">2019, and hence the Trustees were required to serve the application by 24 June 2019. That was a generous period of nearly five months. The Trustees’ June application to postpone the hearing date was made on 7 June 2019, prior to the expiry of the period for service. There were three problems with this application. First, it did not explicitly seek an extension of time for service of the substantive application. Secondly, the witness statement of Ms Unsworth in support of the application made no mention of the limitation position. (HH and Mr House do not complain that the Trustees thereby failed to comply with their duty of disclosure on a without notice application, however.) Thirdly, although Ms Unsworth stated that the substantive application had not been served on any of the respondents, she did not suggest that the Trustees had had any difficulty in serving the respondents other than Mr Burnett (<span style="font-weight:bold">“the nonBurnett respondents”</span>). Rather, she said that it was the Trustees’ intention to serve the substantive application on all the respondents at the same time once the June application had been determined and she requested that the hearing on 9 July 2019 be put back in order to give the court time to deal with the June application and (assuming that the application for permission to serve out was successful) for Mr Burnett to be served and to respond to the substantive application. Thus it appears that the reason for the delay in serving the non-Burnett respondents was the preparation and making of the application for service out of the jurisdiction on Mr Burnett. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">DDJ Hebblethwaite cannot be criticised for making the order he did given that the limitation position was not drawn to his attention. But what order should he have made if it had been? Subject to the point I have made in paragraph 69 above, I agree with Nugee LJ that he should have approached the matter in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Cecil v Bayat</span>. Approaching the matter in that way, I consider that the only correct exercise of his discretion would have been to refuse an extension of time for service of the substantive application on the non-Burnett respondents: the Trustees had had plenty of time in which serve the non-Burnett respondents and the need to obtain permission to serve the substantive application on Mr Burnett outside the jurisdiction was not a good reason for delaying service on the non-Burnett respondents. It was perfectly sensible for the Trustees to seek directions for the claim against Mr Burnett to proceed in accordance with the same timetable as the claims against the non-Burnett respondents, but that did not require service on the non-Burnett respondents to be delayed, still less for it to be delayed until (as it turned out) 6 September 2019 i.e. over 10 weeks after the original date for service and over seven months after the substantive application was issued. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The effect of this would have depended on when the application was dealt with, however. DDJ Hebblethwaite dealt with the June application on the papers, presumably as part of the boxwork assigned to him in the week commencing 24 June 2019. By the time that DDJ Hebblethwaite made his order, the Trustees were out of time for serving the substantive application on the non-Burnett respondents for 9 July 2019. If one imagines that the court had assigned the June application to DDJ Hebblethwaite in the week commencing 7 June 2019 and that he had made an order refusing an extension of time during the course of that week, then the Trustees would have been able to serve the substantive application on the non-Burnett respondents in time for 9 July 2019. The reason why that did not happen was that the Trustees not only did not draw the limitation position to the court’s attention, but also did not request that the June application be dealt with expeditiously. </p>

Accordingly, I agree with Nugee LJ’s conclusion on ground 5. As Nugee LJ has explained, in those circumstances it is not necessary to consider ground 6. </p>
