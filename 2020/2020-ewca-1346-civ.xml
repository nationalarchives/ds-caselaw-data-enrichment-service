	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A 13 year old girl, RD, together with three of her friends, steals a sarong worth £20 from Primark. She is arrested and admits the offence. The police decide not to prosecute and instead administer a reprimand. After completing her schooling, RD goes to university and obtains a degree in criminology. She decides to pursue a career in the police service and applies to South Wales Police for a job as a service support officer, with a view to gaining experience in order to apply to become a police constable in due course. She is asked to disclose whether she has any convictions or cautions and discloses the reprimand, by now eight years in the past. She has had no other contact with the criminal justice system in the meanwhile and, apart from the reprimand, is of unblemished good character. Her application is rejected out of hand </p>

The rejection not only means that she is unable to pursue her chosen career in public service, but also brings on a major depressive illness. Her consultant psychiatrist advises that it is essential for her mental health that the reprimand is removed from her records, but her application for its deletion is refused. Instead the Chief Constable decides that it should be retained on the Police National Computer until she is deemed to have reached the age of 100. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is now common ground between the parties to this appeal that the rejection, by reason of the reprimand, of RD’s application for the position of police support officer was unlawful. The reprimand which RD received was “spent” (in fact it was spent as soon as it was issued) and she should not have been asked to disclose it when she applied in 2015 to become a police support officer. While there are some positions to which the Rehabilitation of Offenders legislation does not apply, the position of police support officer is not (and since 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 has not been) one of them. But the exceptions to the legislation do apply when a person applies to become a police constable or a police cadet to undergo training with a view to becoming a constable. The legislation requires such an applicant, if so requested by the employer, to disclose all convictions and cautions, even those which are spent. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On RD’s application for judicial review the Divisional Court (Fulford LJ and Green J) held that the rejection of RD’s application was unlawful under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, not only because she should not have been asked about reprimands when applying for a position as a support officer, but also because in substance it served to preclude her from seeking employment as a constable or a cadet within the police service; and that the policy which then applied to deal with such applications (“the ACPO 2012 vetting policy”) was unlawful for the same reasons. The court granted a declaration that the Rehabilitation of Offenders 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 as amended, the statutory instrument which requires aspiring police constables to disclose spent convictions and cautions, was incompatible with Article 8 to the extent that (in substance) it requires an applicant for a position as a police constable or cadet to disclose what the court described as “low level, historical cautions”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Divisional Court decided not to grant any declaration relating to the ACPO 2012 vetting policy.

That new Code of Practice has since been issued. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Police National Computer (“the PNC”), before the Divisional Court she conceded that its retention was not unlawful for all purposes. She accepted that it was lawful to retain the reprimand permanently so that it would be available to the sentencing judge in criminal proceedings in the event of her committing any further offence. Her challenge was to its retention for the purpose of disclosure to prospective employers. However, the Divisional Court was persuaded that this was not a suitable case in which to review the legality of the retention of a record of the reprimand and did not do so (and we were told that, since the judgment of the Divisional Court, RD’s reprimand has in fact been deleted from the PNC by South Wales Police). The court focused instead on its disclosure to a prospective employer, here the police<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> Strictly, of course, a police constable holds an office and is not employed, but it is convenient to use this terminology.<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> </span></p>
	      </authorialNote>, and the use which that employer could make of it in assessing an employment application. The result is that as this appeal reaches this court, the issue of retention is not before us; the ACPO 2012 vetting policy on use has been held to be unlawful and there is no appeal from that decision; that policy has now been superseded; but the new policy, the 2017 Vetting Code, post-dated the decision of the Divisional Court and is not the subject of any challenge (or submissions) before us. </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription"> The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 distinguishes between a “child” (under 14) and a “young person” (under 18). I use the word “child” to mean any person under 18. </p>
	      </authorialNote>, regardless of the circumstances, is compatible with Article 8. However, that is to some extent an artificial question. The police will of course have access to the information on the PNC and, as part of the necessary process of vetting any applicant, will therefore learn of any convictions or cautions which the applicant may have, whether or not he or she is required to disclose them. A critical question, therefore, concerns the use to which that information may be put when considering the application. But that question is not before us. </p>

The first is whether the legislation requiring disclosure by would-be police constables of reprimands received as a child is “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8(2). The second is whether it is “necessary in a democratic society … for the prevention of disorder or crime … or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. </p>

The legislation was extended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”) to apply to cautions in December 2008. A caution (which includes a reprimand issued to a child under 18 under sections 65 and 66 of the Crime &amp; Disorder Act 1998: see section 135(5) of the Legal Aid Sentencing &amp; Punishment of Offenders Act 2012) becomes spent as soon as it is administered: para 1 of Schedule 2 of the 1974 Act as amended. </p>

It provides, in outline, that all “conviction data” (which includes cautions and reprimands) will be retained until the record subject is deemed to have reached 100 years of age. Chief Officers have a discretion to delete records, but it appears that this is only expected to be exercised in exceptional circumstances – in practice, where the record is inaccurate or where there is some wider public interest involved.   </p>

It added that, where there is a discretion to be exercised, domestic law must “indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred … and the manner of its exercise”.

It further refers to the absence of any mechanism for independent review of a decision to retain or disclose data, either under common law police powers or pursuant to Part V of the 1997 Act. Finally, the Court notes the limited filtering arrangements in respect of disclosures made under the provisions of the 1997 Act: as regards mandatory disclosure under section 113A, no distinction is made on the basis of the nature of the offence, the disposal in the case, the time which has elapsed since the offence took place or the relevance of the data to the employment sought. </p>

Because of the offences which they had committed, all four were required, even under the more nuanced version of the legislation as it stood after the 2013 Order, either to disclose their convictions and cautions despite the fact that they were spent or to apply to the Disclosure and Barring Service for a Criminal Record Certificate under Part V of the Police Act 1997 which would result in their convictions or cautions being disclosed to their prospective employer.

They turn on two competing public interests. One is the rehabilitation of ex-offenders. The other is the protection of the public against people whose past record suggests that there may be unacceptable risks in appointing them to certain sensitive occupations. The importance of both public interests needs no emphasis. The ability of ex-offenders to obtain employment is often an essential condition of their successful reintegration into law-abiding society at what, especially in the case of young offenders, may be a critical period of their lives. On the other hand, in some employment sectors a more cautious approach is indispensable. The Bichard Inquiry (2004) (HC 653) into child protection procedures and vetting practices was a stark reminder of the importance of ensuring that the rehabilitation of offenders does not undermine proper standards of public protection when those with criminal records apply for jobs involving contact with children. The Inquiry had been set up after two young girls had been murdered by a caretaker employed at their school, about whom there had been substantial intelligence in police files, not retained or disclosed to the school, suggesting a pattern of sexual interference with women and young girls.” </p>

It follows that in conferring power on the Secretary of State, by section 4(4), to exclude the operation of sections 4(2) and 4(3) in specified circumstances, Parliament envisaged that there would be occupations in respect of which convictions should be disclosed to a potential employer, professional body or appointing authority notwithstanding that they were spent and notwithstanding that the convicted person might be prejudiced by their disclosure. The scheme for the disclosure of criminal records by the Disclosure and Barring Service (or AccessNI in Northern Ireland) under the Police Act 1997 is carefully tailored to match the disclosure obligations of the person whose record is in question.

For a measure to have the quality of law, it must be possible to discover, if necessary with the aid of professional advice, what its provisions are. In other words, it must be published and comprehensible. The requirement of foreseeability, so far as it adds to the requirement of accessibility, is essentially concerned with the principle summed up in the adage of the American founding father John Adams, ‘a government of laws and not of men’. A measure is not ‘in accordance with the law’ if it purports to authorise an exercise of power unconstrained by law. The measure must not therefore confer a discretion so broad that its scope is in practice dependent on the will of those who apply it, rather than on the law itself. Nor should it be couched in terms so vague or so general as to produce substantially the same effect in practice. The breadth of a measure and the absence of safeguards for the rights of individuals are relevant to its quality as law where the measure confers discretions, in terms or in practice, which make its effects insufficiently foreseeable. Thus a power whose exercise is dependent on the judgment of an official as to when, in what circumstances or against whom to apply it, must be sufficiently constrained by some legal rule governing the principles on which that decision is to be made. But a legal rule imposing a duty to take some action in every case to which the rule applies does not necessarily give rise to the same problem. It may give rise to a different problem when it comes to necessity and proportionality, but that is another issue. If the question is how much discretion is too much, the only legal tool available for resolving it is a proportionality test which, unlike the test of legality, is a question of degree.”  </p>

It is still the case that it fails to draw distinctions based on the relevance of the conviction to a potential employer on more general grounds; and it still does not provide a mechanism for the independent review of disclosure. However, even on the most expansive view of what was decided in <span style="font-style:italic">T </span>, nothing in that case suggests that these two factors are on their own enough to deprive the legislation of the quality of law. The current legislation distinguishes, for the purpose of disclosure, between different categories of conviction or caution, depending on the gravity of the offence, the age of the offender at the time and the number of years which have passed. Of course, there may be arguments for more or fewer, or wider or narrower categories, but the legality test is a fundamentally unsuitable instrument for assessing differences of degree of this kind. A decision that the current regime governing retention and disclosure of criminal records lacked the quality of law would mean that it would be incompatible with the Convention even if, hypothetically, it could be shown that nothing short of it would sufficiently protect children and vulnerable adults from substantial risks of abuse or protect the public interest in the appointment of suitable people to highly sensitive positions. I decline to accept that proposition. It would have the practical effect of equating the right of privacy with such absolute provisions of the Convention as the prohibition of torture and slavery, when the terms of article 8 show that the right of privacy is qualified.” </p>

The legislation would not be disproportionate, therefore, merely because a court might have drawn the boundaries differently. His conclusion at [61] was, with two exceptions, that it did, allowing for the margin of judgment properly allowed to the legislature or the Secretary of State. One of those exceptions however, is of particular relevance to the present case: </p>

The second exception concerns warnings and reprimands administered to young offenders under sections 65 and 66 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 replaced, since 2013, by youth cautions under section 66ZA. Warnings and reprimands were not a penal procedure. As Lord Bingham put it in relation to warnings in <span style="font-style:italic">R (R) v Durham Constabulary</span> [2005] 1 WLR 1184 (HL), although they required the offender to have admitted the offence, they constituted a ‘preventative, curative, rehabilitative or welfare-promoting’ disposal: see paras 14-15. A caution administered to an adult requires consent. However, a warning or reprimand given to a young offender whose moral bearings are still in the course of formation, requires no consent and does not involve the determination of a criminal charge. Its purpose is wholly instructive, and its use as an alternative to prosecution is designed to avoid any deleterious effect on his subsequent life. Its disclosure to a potential employer would be directly inconsistent with that purpose. In my view the inclusion of warnings and reprimands administered to a young offender among offences which must be disclosed is a category error, and as such an error of principle. I would expect the same to be true of the current regime governing youth cautions, but we were not addressed on that question and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to decide it on this appeal.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Straw’s second factor begs the question, in my judgment, whether there are some cautions (including reprimands) which are not at least <span style="font-style:italic">potentially</span> relevant to the position of a police constable. As I shall explain when dealing with the issue of proportionality, the submission of the Secretaries of State and the NPCC is that it is essential to maintain public confidence in the police that all convictions and cautions are at least disclosed, so that they can be taken into account in the recruitment decision. That is not to say that they should operate to disqualify an applicant, but only that their relevance can be considered and that the public can be confident that this has been done. To that extent it can be said that all convictions and cautions are potentially relevant. </p>

The disclosure regime has a legal basis in domestic law: it is entirely statutory, consisting of primary legislation together with regulations which have been subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and whose operation as it applies to the police has been explained to Parliament in clear terms. It is accessible: although the regulations are somewhat convoluted (in particular, in providing that even a protected caution has to be disclosed by a would-be constable, Articles 3ZA and 4ZA constitute an exception to an exception), it is ultimately entirely clear that an applicant for the position of police constable must, if asked, disclose any conviction or caution, regardless of its age or circumstances, including any reprimand received as a child. It is foreseeable: there is no exercise of discretion involved, let alone one which is so broad as to be unpredictable. </p>

They point out that Parliament has since 1975 consistently required that those applying to become police officers should be required to disclose any conviction or caution, and that this regime was maintained by the 2013 Order when the scope of the exceptions to the 1974 Act was narrowed. They say that it is critical that public protection should be ensured and public confidence in the police service maintained, by enabling police forces to vet thoroughly those applying for the office of constable, and that this objective can only be achieved by the regime currently provided in the 2013 Order. The “bright line rule” applying to police constables is therefore necessary.  </p>

He supplemented this by pointing out that employers in the public sector must comply with a Code of Practice which requires them to have a written policy concerning the suitability of ex-offenders, to notify candidates of the potential impact of a criminal record and to discuss with candidates the content of any disclosure before withdrawing an offer of employment.

Until 2017 the applicable policy was the ACPO 2012 vetting policy. Thereafter it was the 2017 Police Vetting Code of Practice. The Divisional Court held that the 2012 policy was unlawful. That decision has not been challenged before us but, for my part, I agree with it. It means, in effect, that until 2017 the police could not (in Lord Sumption’s words) be trusted to take an objective view of the true relevance of what the Divisional Court described as “low level, historical cautions”. </p>

The second exception concerns warnings and reprimands administered to young offenders under sections 65 and 66 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 replaced, since 2013, by youth cautions under section 66ZA. Warnings and reprimands were not a penal procedure. As Lord Bingham put it in relation to warnings in <span style="font-style:italic">R (R) v Durham Constabulary</span> [2005] 1 WLR 1184 (HL), although they required the offender to have admitted the offence, they constituted a ‘preventative, curative, rehabilitative or welfare-promoting’ disposal: see paras 14-15. A caution administered to an adult requires consent. However, a warning or reprimand given to a young offender whose moral bearings are still in the course of formation, requires no consent and does not involve the determination of a criminal charge. Its purpose is wholly instructive, and its use as an alternative to prosecution is designed to avoid any deleterious effect on his subsequent life. Its disclosure to a potential employer would be directly inconsistent with that purpose. In my view the inclusion of warnings and reprimands administered to a young offender among offences which must be disclosed is a category error, and as such an error of principle. I would expect the same to be true of the current regime governing youth cautions, but we were not addressed on that question and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to decide it on this appeal.” </p>

However, it is clear that the Supreme Court was not concerned with or focusing on the rule applicable to would-be police constables (or indeed the other positions where full disclosure is still required) and did not have before it any of the evidence relating to the need for constables to be people of undoubted integrity and the importance of public confidence in police recruitment procedures which I have summarised.

But the question is not whether the importance of maintaining police integrity and public confidence is sufficient to justify requiring disclosure of RD’s reprimand. Rather it is whether it is sufficient to justify requiring an applicant for the position of police constable to disclose any reprimand received as a child.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Taking the first and second issues together, I have no doubt that the importance of maintaining police integrity and public confidence is of fundamental importance and that the requirement that all cautions should be disclosed, including reprimands received as a child, is rationally connected to that objective. It promotes public trust to know that nothing in an officer’s background has been held back before he or she is entrusted with the powers which a constable has, and that anything potentially relevant has been taken into account even if, in the end, it did not prevent an offer of employment. Some reprimands will be given for entirely trivial matters, such as in RD’s case, but others may be more serious. For example, as Ms Foulds pointed out in her evidence, even the offence of theft may be committed in a wide range of circumstances, varying from minor shoplifting to serious abuse of trust, while any attempt to draw a line based on the value of goods taken would necessarily be arbitrary. Similarly, reprimands may be given in circumstances which say something about the character of the applicant. The example was given of a 17 year old child involved in county lines drug supply who was reprimanded rather than prosecuted because he had been acting under pressure from others: it would be relevant for the police at least to know that a potential constable had succumbed to blackmail in this way.  </p>

That is for two reasons. First, because we are concerned, as I have explained, with the rule that all reprimands should be disclosed. Second, because the question is not whether a reprimand rendered her unsuitable to be a police constable, but rather whether it was something which the police ought to know before deciding whether she was a suitable person to be a constable. </p>

For example, he suggested that disclosure of protected cautions could have been dispensed with; or that a different regime could have applied depending on the age of the applicant. No doubt these would have been possibilities, but none of them would be capable of satisfying what I regard as the legitimate legislative objective of ensuring public confidence that anything of potential relevance has been taken into account in police recruitment decisions.  </p>

I regard that as thoroughly unrealistic. It would create two categories of constable, those who can be fully deployed to all the roles which police officers perform and those whose careers in the police will be highly restricted. A careful judgment needs to be made. There will be some reprimands which, if disclosed to the CPS and then to the defence, may prejudice a criminal prosecution. In other cases that possibility will be farfetched, as the Divisional Court concluded (and I agree) would be the position in RD’s case. But that is not an argument for saying that some reprimands should not be disclosed when applying to become a constable. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a rule which required disclosure only of reprimands which the CPS might think would need to be disclosed to the defence and which a judge might think should be admitted in evidence under section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The only safe rule is that the reprimand should be disclosed so that a sensible and informed view could be reached – or at least, the Secretary of State was entitled so to conclude. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, the question is whether the bright line rule requiring full disclosure strikes a fair balance between the interests of would-be constables and the interests of the community. On the one hand, the public has a strong interest in ensuring the integrity of police constables and in the assurance that all matters of potential relevance have been taken into account when making recruitment decisions. On the other hand, we are concerned only with the requirement to disclose and a policy exists which governs the use which may be made in the recruitment process of the information thus disclosed. In considering the overall question of fairness, it is necessary to take account not only of the requirement to disclose, but also the existence of safeguards as to the use which may be made of the disclosed information. If those safeguards are inadequate, as the Divisional Court has held that they were before 2017, an otherwise suitable applicant who is refused employment by reason of a reprimand will have a remedy. But his or her proper complaint will not be that the reprimand should not have been disclosed. Rather it will be that the police have misused the disclosure in rejecting the application, either because the policy itself is unlawful or because it has not been properly applied. In those circumstances I conclude that the requirement for full disclosure does strike a fair balance between the interests involved.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For these reasons I would hold that the requirement for full disclosure by a would-be police constable of all convictions and cautions, including reprimands received as a child, is in accordance with the law within the meaning of Article 8 ECHR and that it is necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime or for the protection of the rights or freedoms of others. I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the declaration made by the Divisional Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I add three final comments. The first is that, as was common ground by the conclusion of the argument before us, it would not in any event have been right to uphold the declaration in the terms made by the Divisional Court. That declaration used a formula which, as I understand it, was agreed by the parties in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">P</span>, but the reference to “low-level, historical cautions” is of uncertain application. Had I been minded to dismiss the appeal, it would have been necessary to express any declaration in more precise terms. As it is, the point does not arise. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, it will be particularly important that police recruitment material, and especially any form which applicants must complete, makes clear that a reprimand received as a child is not an automatic disqualification for appointment as a constable and that all the circumstances of any reprimand will be taken into account fairly in assessing any application. That is necessary to counteract as far as possible any chilling effect on applications which the requirement to disclose may have. It is all the more important in view of the disproportionate number of reprimands issued to BAME children when compared to the population as a whole and the impact which the requirement of full disclosure may have on the vital social objective of recruiting a more diverse police force which commands the confidence of all sections of society. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, while this judgment has necessarily focused on the position of would-be police constables in general, it is important not to lose sight of the undoubted fact that this claimant was shabbily treated by the South Wales police. Sadly, it may be too late, in her case, for a fulfilling career within the police service, but it seems to me that any policy which resulted in the application of an otherwise well qualified candidate like </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As Males LJ explains, the shape of the issues on this appeal is rather odd.  There is no question that the refusal of RD’s application by South Wales Police was unlawful, because she was applying for employment as a police support officer but they applied to her a policy applicable only to the recruitment of constables (and cadets); or that that policy was in any event unlawful. I would also add that the way in which she was treated appears to have been unreasonable and insensitive.  That is not in issue before us, and to that extent she has won her case.  However, the Divisional Court did go on to consider whether the regime that would have been applicable to her if she had been applying to be a constable was compatible with article 8 of the Convention; and we must decide whether the declaration that it made in that regard was correct.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For the reasons that he gives, I agree with Males LJ that the exclusion of applicants to become a constable from the “protected caution” provisions of the 1975 Order (as amended) is both “in accordance with the law” and proportionate and accordingly that it gives rise to no breach of article 8; and I would accordingly allow the appeal.  However, I would wish, like him, to emphasise that the question whether it is lawful, in the case of an application to become a constable, to require the <span style="font-style:italic">disclosure</span> of all past reprimands is a quite separate question from how that information should be <span style="font-style:italic">used</span>; and the outcome of the appeal does not imply that such an application can be refused on the basis of any past reprimand, however trivial the offence and whatever the age of the applicant at the time.  The current Vetting Code of Practice gives guidance to decision-makers about how to treat past convictions and youth cautions.  The lawfulness of that Code is not challenged on this appeal; but I would associate myself entirely with what Males LJ says at the end of para. 95 of his judgment.    </p>
