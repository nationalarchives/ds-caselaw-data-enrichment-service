Her case, supported by evidence from her mother and Mr E, was that Mr E would give her mother money to send to her in the Philippines “at least once every quarter”.  She provided proof of five remittances sent between 1996 and 2004, in the total sum of some £560. </p>

An Algerian court had placed an abandoned child under the kefalah guardianship of married EU citizens.  The ruling of the CJEU was that the child was an extended family member but not a direct descendant of the EU citizens because the relationship created by kefalah was not a parent-child relationship.  The Court noted that the meaning and scope of the concept of a ‘direct descendant’ is an autonomous concept of EU law and that it is not defined in the Directive (see paragraphs 50-51).

It follows that the concept of a ‘direct descendant’ of a citizen of the Union referred to in Article 2(2)(c) of Directive 2004/38 must be understood as including both the biological and the adopted child of such a citizen, since it is established that adoption creates a legal parent-child relationship between the child and the citizen of the Union concerned. </p>

In the present case a ‘real-world’ parental relationship exists between the Appellant and Mr E and he is her <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> stepfather.  The fact that her mother and Mr E never married does not make any difference to a relationship that has existed for 25 years.  In what he accepts is a novel submission, he argues that society has evolved and that the tribunals erred in failing to look to the substance of a relationship that is functionally equivalent to a biological or legal relationship.  (The concept of ‘functional equivalence’ originates in the opinion of the Advocate General in <span style="font-style:italic">SM</span> where, at paragraph 33, he poses the question whether kefalah could be considered to be functionally equivalent to an adoptive relationship: but this question was answered in the negative at paragraph 82 and subsequently by the Court.)  </p>

The recitals to the Directive show that Articles 2 and 3, as reflected in Regulations 7 and 8, are designed to distinguish between ‘family members’ and ‘extended family members’ and to provide for the former, but not the latter, to enjoy an automatic right of entry and residence.  It would be contrary to the intention of the Directive to blur that distinction.  Clarity and predictability about who is and who is not a direct descendant would be replaced by the need for a qualitative assessment of the substance of a wide range of social or <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>relationships.  Under this approach, any step-child could argue that they were a direct descendant, and indeed that they were a direct descendant of more than one family.  There is no good reason to accept an approach that comes at such a high cost to legal certainty in order to accommodate relationships that are in reality extended family relationships if they are anything.  </p>

That argument was in any event convincingly despatched by Ms Smyth, who points out that it is not contrary to EU law to treat unmarried partners and spouses differently because, as the UT noted, the difference in treatment is deliberately built into the EU legal order.  Moreover, it is reflected in the decisions of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">O and B</span> Case C-673/16; [2014] QB 1163, <span style="font-style:italic">SSHD v Banger </span>Case C-89/17; [2019] 1 CMLR 6 and <span style="font-style:italic">Coman v Inspectoratul General pentru Imigrări </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Case C-673/16;</span> [2019] 1 WLR 425.

She also argued that it was unreasonable to have expected her to produce more documentary evidence after such a passage of time.  But in the UT, Judge Hanson described the FTT as having considered the evidence that had been made available with the required degree of anxious scrutiny.  The conclusion that the Appellant had failed to satisfy the requisite test was not shown to be irrational or not reasonably available to the judge on the evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On this appeal, the Appellant’s ground of appeal was simply that the UT had erred in not finding that the FTT was wrong about dependency.  In his written submission Mr Ó Ceallaigh (who did not appear below) charges the FTT with a failure to carry out the holistic examination of dependency mandated by the Upper Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">Reyes</span>.  He concedes that in this case, there being no evidence that the Appellant had met Mr E before coming to the UK, any previous dependency could only have been of a financial nature.  He nonetheless argues that the FTT gave insufficient weight to the evidence of the three witnesses, who gave clear evidence of significant support.   </p>

He contended that the absence of any specific reference to the evidence of the Appellant’s mother was a critical flaw in the determination: had her evidence been properly considered, the dependency claim was, he said, bound to have succeeded.   He also emphasised the difficulty for an applicant in producing comprehensive documentary evidence after such a passage of time, and suggested that the limited number of remittance documents may have been because others could not be found.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In response, Ms Smyth notes the high hurdle facing an appellant in establishing an error of law in relation to a conclusion of fact.  It essentially requires a conclusion either that there was no evidence to support the challenged finding of fact, or that the finding was one that no reasonable judge could have reached: <span style="font-style:italic">Perry v Raleys Solicitors</span> [2019] 2 WLR 636, [2019] UKSC 5 at [52], summarising much previous authority.  That cannot be said in this case.  The Appellant simply did not produce documentary or oral evidence of sufficient cogency to survive the scrutiny appropriate to a case of alleged adult dependency.  Here, the documentary evidence was limited and, to use the language of the Upper Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">Reyes</span>, the oral evidence had been ‘found wanting’.  This ground of appeal is no more than a disagreement with the FTT’s assessment of evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Smyth further objected that the oral arguments about the absence of reference in the FTT decision to the evidence of the Appellant’s mother had not been a ground of appeal before the UT and was not a ground of appeal to this court.  As to the possibility of documents having been lost (an argument made in the grounds of appeal to the UT, but not in the grounds of appeal to this court) the written evidence of the Appellant and her witnesses made no such claim: on the contrary, their complaint was that the Secretary of State had not properly considered those that had been produced.  To this Mr Ó Ceallaigh replied that his oral arguments were implicit in the grounds of appeal and in his written submissions; if they were not, they were <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson</span>-obvious (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Robinson</span> [1997] 3 WLR 1162). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would however comment on the additional submissions made by Mr Ó Ceallaigh as recorded at paragraph 28.  Any counsel appearing for the first time on an appeal will seek to refresh the arguments so as to present them in the most persuasive way, and I do not criticise counsel for his efforts on behalf of this Appellant.  Nor should a party be penalised for drafting grounds of appeal concisely.  However, these arguments were not pleaded at all on this appeal and in my view they cannot be raised now.  An appeal court can entertain a new argument of law where that is in the interests of justice (though it will be slow to do so) – <span style="font-style:italic">Miscovic v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 16 per Elias LJ at [69], Sedley LJ at [109-112] and Moore-Bick LJ at [134] – but these arguments relate entirely to an assessment of the facts and they cannot fairly be raised on the hoof.  They are not <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson</span>-obvious points that the tribunals or court could be expected to appreciate for themselves in a case where the Appellant was represented by counsel.

The lack of specific reference to the evidence of her mother is of no special significance as her written evidence was the same as that of the Appellant and Mr E.  Nor does the record contain any indication that the Appellant had told the Secretary of State or the FTT that the remittance documents were samples only.  The evidence of the Appellant’s mother, which draws both matters together, was that “We have submitted numerous remittance slips confirming regular and consistent money transfers to Philippines, which were unfortunately not considered by the Home Office.”  </p>
