	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Secretary of State appeals, with permission granted by Leggatt LJ (as he then was) against the Order dated 17 April 2019 of Morris J, that the Direction given by the Secretary of State on 25 September 2017 to the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”) under section 5(2) of the Communications Act 2003 (“CA 2003”) be quashed. The Direction sought to prevent Ofcom from introducing regulations which would have the effect of making it lawful to operate a species of GSM gateway known as a commercial multi-user gateway (“COMUG”) without a licence. GSM gateways are telecommunications equipment which contain one or more SIM cards such as are placed in mobile phones. They enable phone calls and text messages from landlines to be routed directly on to mobile networks with the intention of saving money on call charges. Commercial deployment of a GSM gateway may be as a commercial single user gateway (“COSUG”) or as a COMUG. COSUGs are gateways serving a single end-user, such as a large commercial entity. In contrast, COMUGs involve the use of a GSM gateway to provide an electronic communications service to multiple end users. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Direction was given because of national security and public safety concerns about the use of COMUGs. When a call is made from a land line or a mobile phone, information identifying the calling party is transmitted over the network as is information as to the user’s location in the case of a mobile phone. However, where a call is routed through a GSM gateway, communications data about the caller is not conveyed to the network. Instead that data is replaced only by the number and location of the SIM card in the GSM gateway, making it almost impossible for communications data about the call or the caller to be ascertained in the case of COMUGs. This gives rise to serious national security and public safety concerns, not challenged before the judge or before this Court. </p>

In 2003, mobile network operators ceased supplying SIM cards to GSM gateway operators which led to the collapse of the respondent’s business. It went into administration in 2005 and into liquidation in February 2010. Since 2003, it has been involved in a number of legal challenges, with the aim of securing the liberalisation of COMUG use. </p>

At first instance, Rose J (as she then was) held that the public security justification was available in law as a matter of both EU and domestic law and that on the facts it was made out in respect of COMUGs but not COSUGs: [2013] EWHC 3091 (Ch); [2014] 2 CMLR 2 (“<span style="font-style:italic">Recall HC</span>”).

GSM gateways qualify as "wireless telegraphy apparatus" within the meaning s.1 WTA 1949, and now under s.8 WTA 2006. The requirement for an individual licence was subject to a power to make regulations providing for exemptions. Whilst under the Wireless Telegraphy (Exemption) Regulations 1999 a broad range of equipment was exempted from the licensing requirement, Regulation 4(2) of those Regulations had the effect that commercial use of GSM gateways remained subject to the individual licensing requirement. This is the Commercial Use Restriction. That was carried over to Regulation 4(2) of the Wireless Telegraphy (Exemption) Regulations 2003 ("the 2003 Exemption Regulations"). The decision to do so was based, substantially, upon security considerations: <span style="font-style:italic">Recall CA</span> §38.

The current EU regime is the Common Regulatory Framework ("CRF"), introduced in 2002 and which had to be implemented by 24 July 2003. The CRF includes Directive 2002/20/EC of 7 March 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (the "Authorisation Directive"). That Directive provides for two forms of authorisation, namely general authorisation (where no specific application for a licence is required) and individual rights of use subject to a licence (requiring application by a regulator). Article 5(1) of the Authorisation Directive (as subsequently amended) provides that Member States shall facilitate the use of radio frequencies under general authorisations, but that, where necessary, individual rights of use may be granted in order to avoid harmful interference, ensure technical quality of service, safeguard efficient use of spectrum, or fulfil other objectives of general interest as defined by Member States in conformity with Community law.  </p>

The powers conferred on the Secretary of State by s.1 WTA 1949 to grant licences and to make exemption regulations were transferred to Ofcom. In particular, Article 5(1) of the Authorisation Directive was implemented by the introduction, into WTA 1949, of a proviso to s.1(1) for the discretionary making of regulations to exempt from individual licence and of a new s.1AA, imposing a duty on Ofcom to make regulations exempting the use of relevant apparatus from the licensing requirement in s.1(1) WTA 1949, when satisfied that the use of such operations was "not likely to involve any undue interference with wireless telegraphy".  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The judge then turned to his analysis and discussion. At [53] he said that the prior question to whether as the Secretary of State contended Ofcom was under a duty to follow a direction given under section 5(2) was whether the Secretary of State had a power to make a direction in the first place to Ofcom not to carry out its duty under section 8(4) or any other duty. The judge’s starting point was that a restrictive approach to construction was required as clear words were required to give a power by way of secondary legislation to override a statutory duty imposed by other primary legislation. He concluded for a number of reasons that as a matter of construction a direction “not to carry out a duty cannot be a direction to carry out that duty and thus cannot be a direction to Ofcom to carry out its functions within section 5(2) of CA 2003.”   </p>

He said that the respondent submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">Hazell </span>could be distinguished on the grounds that the relevant provision was an empowering provision “running with the grain” of the underlying duties, rather than the present case where the power sought to be exercised contradicts the underlying duty. That raised the question whether there is power to make the Direction rather than the question of what “function” means in the sub-section.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, at [56] the judge concluded that “carry out” in section 5(2) of CA 2003 connoted performing or discharging Ofcom’s functions. He considered that if the words “carry out” were applied specifically to the duty under section 8(4) of WTA 2006, as a matter of construction a direction <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to carry out a duty cannot be a direction to carry out that duty or even a direction “in relation to” the carrying out of that duty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">his judgment at [45] to [48]. As he said, one of the principal issues was whether a direction by the Secretary of State under section 5(1) of the WTA 2006 was capable of displacing statutory duties upon Ofcom under sections 3 and 4 CA 2003. The Court of Appeal held that a direction in relation to a function of Ofcom (to which section 5(1) of WTA 2006 is addressed) could not relieve Ofcom of a statutory duty placed upon it. The judge rejected the various arguments of the Secretary of State seeking to distinguish <span style="font-style:italic">EE</span> and he considered that [54] of Patten LJ’s lead judgment was particularly supportive of the respondent’s case:  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“The question therefore arises whether s.5 authorises the Secretary of State to direct Ofcom in exercising its s.12 powers to ignore the duties imposed on it by s.4(2) of CA 2003 and s.3(5) of WTA 2006. In my view, it does not. Parliament has imposed those duties on Ofcom (compatibly with Article 8 of the Framework Directive) to be performed "in carrying out" its radio spectrum functions. It did not obviously contemplate or in my view authorise the performance of the Article 8 duty by someone who was not the regulator and who was not carrying out the relevant function to which the duty relates. In the absence of clear words, the s.4(2) duty is to be treated as non-delegable and there is nothing in s.5 of WTA 2006 which in terms allows the Secretary of State to relieve Ofcom of the statutory duties which Parliament has expressly imposed on it. The language of s.5 is entirely neutral.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifth, the judge said at [59] that Ofcom’s duty under section 4(2) CA 2003 to “act in accordance with” Community requirements in “carrying out” its functions does not assist in construing the words “carry out in accordance with” in section 5(2) CA 2003. He said it is not clear that any Community requirement imposed a “duty” not to carry out other duties and in any event, unlike section 5(2), section 3(6) CA 2003 makes express provision for any consequential conflict between the section 4(2) duty and other duties of Ofcom, as a consequence of which if any Community requirements imposed a duty which conflicted with a duty involved in radio spectrum functions, then the section 4(2) duty takes priority. On the Secretary of State’s construction of section 5(2), section 3(6) would be surplusage. It was notable that there was no equivalent provision to resolve conflicts between competing duties in the case of a duty imposed under section 5(2) CA 2003, which the judge considered gave strong support to the conclusion that section 5(2) does not envisage a stark conflict which would arise from the giving of a direction specifically not to carry out another duty imposed upon Ofcom by the legislation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [60] the judge noted that the Secretary of State relied upon the fact that sub-sections (3A) and (4A) of section 5 CA 2003 expressly placed limitations on the power to give directions under section 5(2) to contend that, applying the maxim <span style="font-style:italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </span>section 5(2) should be interpreted as excluding the implication of any additional limitation on that power. The judge considered that there was some force in that submission but not sufficient to displace the reasoning in the five points he had made. He considered the absence of power under section 5(2) to direct Ofcom not to carry out its statutory duty was not based upon the implication of a limitation but on the absence of clear words conferring the power expressly. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At [62] to [65] the judge referred to other statutory provisions making express provision for resolving a conflict of duties as highlighting the absence of clear words here. First, section 94(3) of the Telecommunications Act 1984 expressly provided that a duty to give effect to a “national security” direction by the Secretary of State under section 94(1) overrides any other statutory duty arising under CA 2003. Second, section 3(5) WTA 2006 expressly provides for what is to happen if Ofcom is placed under conflicting duties by sections 3(1) and (2) WTA 2006 on the one hand and sections 3 to 6 CA 2003 (including its duty under section 5(2)) on the other. Section 3(5) WTA 2006 thus gives express priority to the very duty in question under section 5(2). The judge considered that the absence of a similar provision in relation to section 8 WTA 2006 suggests that it was not contemplated that a section 5(2) direction would conflict with the section 8(4) duty. The judge rejected the attempt on behalf of the Secretary of State to distinguish the position under section 3(5) WTA 2006, specifically the suggestion that there was no conflict-resolving provision in this case because it was envisaged generally that the section 5(2) duty might modify the section 8(4) duty and not seek to override or conflict with it. The judge said that did not explain why there was no such provision to deal with the case where there was such a conflict. Third, the judge referred back to his fifth point about section 3(6) CA 2003 expressly giving priority to Ofcom’s duties under section 4.  </p>

He cited extensively from the judgment of Rose J who, having decided that the public security justification for the Commercial Use Restriction was available under Article 5 of the Authorisation Directive, went on to consider whether it was available as a matter of domestic law. It was argued on behalf of the Secretary of State that even if the public security justification was not included in section 8 of WTA 2006, that aspect of Article 5 was transposed through the route of the power in section 5 CA 2003. Rose J accepted that argument. She went on to address three points raised by the claimants in response, one of which was that a direction under section 5 CA 2003 could not be used to override the duty imposed on Ofcom under section 8 WTA 2006. At [86] she dealt with this point:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On appeal in that case one of the grounds of appeal was that, even if the public security justification for the Commercial Use Restriction was permitted by Article 5 of the Authorisation Directive, the UK had chosen to implement the Directive in a way that provided no basis for reliance on that ground. The Court of Appeal rejected that argument and dismissed the appeal, on the basis that the 2003 Exemption Regulations made before the Directive was implemented and maintained in place by the transitional provisions meant that public security was at all material times an available ground of justification for the Commercial Use Restriction.  In other words, like Rose J, this Court rejected the claimant’s third point on section 5 CA 2003. Again the detail of the reasoning of Richards LJ as set out by Morris J does not matter for present purposes. All that is of significance is how he dealt with the claimant’s first point under section 5, which reflects the issue in the present case. At [56] and [58] of his judgment he said:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“56. The wording of s.5 is, however, problematic. Section 5(2) provides that if directions are given by the Secretary of State, it is the duty of Ofcom to carry out its relevant functions (which include its duty under s.1AA of the 1949 Act to make exempting regulations) "in accordance with those directions". That cannot readily be interpreted as requiring Ofcom, if so directed by the Secretary of State, not to carry out a statutory duty otherwise imposed on it. The wording may be contrasted with the terms of s.94(3) of the Telecommunications Act 1984, quoted above, which require a person to give effect to a direction "notwithstanding any other duty imposed on him", and with the terms of s.3(5) of the 2006 Act, also quoted above, which make clear how a conflict between statutory duties is to be resolved. On this point, therefore, I have greater reservations than did Rose J, who said at [86] of her judgment that she did not see why a direction under s.5 could not be used to override Ofcom's duty to make exempting regulations.

None has needed to be issued in the absence of any decision by Ofcom to make exempting regulations to remove the commercial use restriction. The relationship between s.5 and Ofcom's duty to make exempting regulations has therefore never been put to the test in practice. I have expressed my doubts about the effectiveness of s.5 for the purpose on which the Secretary of State relies on it in these proceedings (and, as explained below, has relied on it in dealings with the European Commission) but I do not think it necessary to reach any concluded view on the subject. That is because, in my judgment, the compatibility of the commercial use restriction with the directive does not depend on whether the Secretary of State has the power under domestic law, by way of a direction under s.5, to prevent Ofcom from making exempting regulations to remove the restriction. I come back to the point that the commercial use restriction, as a valid measure of domestic law which is justified by considerations of public security insofar as it relates to COMUGs, is compatible to that extent with art.5 of the Authorisation Directive.” </p>

At [81] he noted that there were other ways for the Secretary of State to safeguard national security by preventing exemption of COMUGs. The Secretary of State could direct Ofcom under section 5(2) of CA 2003 to impose, under section 8(3) of WTA 2006, conditions or limitations upon the exemption from the requirement for a licence which could be in the same terms as the second and third paragraphs of the Direction. If those conditions were not met, an individual licence would be required and operating without it would be a criminal offence. The judge also said that, if a subsequent national security issue arose in any particular case, the Secretary of State could make a direction under section 132 to suspend entitlement to deliver relevant services.  </p>

As he said at [83], that the respondent’s construction did not lead to absurdity was borne out by the fact that the Home Office had considered a “range of options” other than making the Direction. He also pointed out at [84] that the Secretary of State could always amend section 8 WTA 2006 to expand the list of conditions in section 8(5).  </p>

The problem with a general exemption for COMUGs such as Ofcom was proposing was that you would not know who was using the gateways, whereas with a licensing regime you would have prior scrutiny. He submitted that the power to give a direction under section 5(2) such as was given in the first paragraph of the Direction in the present case was essential to maintaining such prior scrutiny.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">He submitted that there was no reason to suppose that Parliament had intended that the power be limited in the way the judge had found. Before the enactment of CA 2003, the Secretary of State was clearly entitled to maintain a licensing regime for COMUGs which gave rise to national security concerns. That was the whole purpose of the Commercial Use Restriction. The effect of CA 2003 was to establish a dedicated regulator, Ofcom, responsible for the technical aspects of telecommunications regulation, with the Secretary of State remaining responsible for taking any action on national security grounds. Hence section 5(2) CA 2003 and section 1AA WTA 1949 (the predecessor of section 8 WTA 2006) both came into force on 25 July 2003. Section 1AA provided that Ofcom could take account only of the technical issue whether the use of stations or apparatus would be likely to involve any undue interference with wireless telegraphy before deciding whether to exempt such equipment from the default requirement of a licence. If Morris J’s construction of section 5(2) were correct, following this legislative division of responsibility, the Secretary of State suddenly became powerless to insist on a licensing requirement for equipment whose unlicensed use gave rise to national security concerns, however serious, provided only that Ofcom considered that the use of such equipment was not likely to cause any undue interference with wireless telegraphy. Mr Beard QC submitted that there was no good reason why Parliament would have removed such important pre-existing powers of the Secretary of State in that way.  </p>

However, this was not the exercise of Henry VIII-style powers, the use of delegated powers to use secondary delegated legislation as a means of amending primary legislation, where it was well-established that such powers could not be conferred in the absence of clear words. The power to give a direction under section 5(2) was conferred by the section itself, a piece of primary legislation. Mr Beard QC submitted that if there were a conflict between a direction under section 5(2) and the statutory duty of Ofcom under section 8 WTA 2006, it was a conflict between two duties arising under primary legislation.

There is no reference in section 5(1) to a concomitant duty on Ofcom to act “in accordance with” the directions of the Secretary of State. Furthermore, that case was one where the Secretary of State required Ofcom to take certain matters into account when setting licence fees in circumstances where EU law as transposed in section 4(2) CA 2003 and section 3(5) WTA 2006 specifically required Ofcom as regulator to act in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 8 of the Framework Directive.

There was no issue that the Secretary of State was the right person to make national security decisions. The only question was whether she had acted within the law. The judge had been entirely right to conclude that the Secretary of State had exceeded the four corners of her powers. It was common ground that the first sentence of the Direction sought to direct Ofcom to act contrary to its section 8(4) duty. He submitted that the Secretary of State had no power to give such a direction.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, it is quite clear from the statutory scheme that (in accordance with the principle stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Bennion</span>), when Parliament intends that one duty owed by Ofcom should, in the case of conflict, be subordinate to another, it says so expressly. The clearest and most relevant example is what was section 154(4) CA 2003 cited at [46] above. That stated in terms that where Ofcom’s duties in carrying out its functions under that section conflicted with one or more of their duties under sections 3 to 6 of the Act (thus including the very duty under section 5(2) with which the present case is concerned) priority was to be given to the latter duties. Thus, Parliament was well able, when it chose to do so, to make express provision for the section 5(2) duty to take priority over other Ofcom duties. However, it did not make any equivalent express qualification of the obligation to make exemption regulations in section 1AA in WTA 1949 inserted by section 166 CA 2003, nor did it do so when the consolidating statute WTA 2006 was passed a few years later. Section 3(5) of that Act contained the same express qualification as its predecessor, section 154(4) CA 2003, but there was no such express qualification of the obligation to make exemption regulations under section 8(4) of WTA 2006, which replaced section 1AA WTA 1949, either as originally enacted or as amended in 2011. In my judgment, the absence of an express provision that section 5(2) CA 2003 should have priority over section 8(4) WTA 2006 is a very strong pointer to it not having been the intention of Parliament that the Secretary of State should have the power to direct Ofcom not to comply with its duties under section 8(4) WTA 2006.  </p>

Again, this method of drafting an express qualification (as amended by CA 2003 itself) demonstrates that if Parliament had intended that section 5(2) should have priority over section 1AA WTA 1949/section 8(4) WTA 2006, it would have enacted an express provision to that effect. It is to be noted in this context that although Richards LJ did not express a concluded view in <span style="font-style:italic">Recall CA</span> on this issue, the doubts he had as to whether section 5(2) CA 2003 conferred a power on the Secretary of State to direct Ofcom not to comply with a statutory duty imposed upon it, were based upon the fact that the other statutory provisions to which I have referred made clear expressly how conflicts between statutory duties were to be resolved.  </p>

I consider that the sub-section is imposing a duty on Ofcom in relation to functions it actually carries out and “carry out” cannot be extended to include “not carry out”. The first paragraph of the Direction directs Ofcom not to grant exemptions from the requirement for a licence, when section 8(4) WTA 2006 requires it to do so if the conditions in (5) are satisfied, in other words it directs Ofcom not to carry out specific functions when it has a statutory duty to do so. Furthermore, as Mr Segan QC pointed out, the logical consequence of the Secretary of State’s construction of section 5(2) would be that if the Secretary of State considered that it was in the interests of national security to do so, he could direct Ofcom not to carry out any of its functions under Part 2 CA 2003 or WTA 2006, in which case Ofcom would not be “carrying out” any functions at all.    </p>

Both Lord Hoffmann and Lord Sumption have described the maxim as “perilous”. Further, as Stanley Burnton LJ said of the maxim in <span style="font-style:italic">EN (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 630; [2010] QB 633 at [79]: “[it] is not a particularly strong rule, and itself depends on the assumption that what is expressly stated impliedly excludes what is not mentioned.” </p>
