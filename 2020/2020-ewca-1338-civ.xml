	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">A state has the right to control those who wish to enter or remain in its territory, and consequently to set criteria for entitlement to enter or remain and for the removal of those within its borders who have no right to be there.  Where individuals dispute an executive decision that bears upon such entitlement and/or removal, as part of their right to access to justice, they generally have the right to apply to a court or tribunal to challenge that decision.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">In these claims, the Appellants contend that the Secretary of State’s policy for removing those without the right to enter or remain in the UK – which, for those who fall within its scope, after a relatively short notice period in which removal cannot be effected, sets a removal window within which the individual can be removed at any time without further notice – is unlawful as abrogating the right to access to justice in respect of decisions which bear upon their removal.  In brief, it is submitted that the notice period is too short for those affected to instruct lawyers to make representations that leave to enter or remain should be granted, for any such representations to be considered by the Secretary of State, and then for an application to be made to a court or tribunal to challenge any negative decision; and so it is inevitable that many negative decisions affecting their right to remain and their removal (including decisions to extend the notice period or defer the removal window) are made after the notice period has ended, so that they become at risk of immediate removal without an adequate opportunity to challenge the material decision or decisions before a court or tribunal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Below, in the claim brought by FB, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (the President (Lane J) and Upper Tribunal Judge O’Connor) (“the tribunal”) held that the policy, although deficient in a number of respects, was not incompatible with the right to access to justice; and the Secretary of State’s decision to remove FB under it was not unlawful (<span style="text-decoration:underline">R (FB and another) v Secretary of State for</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the Home Department (removal window policy)</span> [2018] UKUT 428 (IAC)).  In a separate claim brought in the public interest by Medical Justice (a charity which facilitates the provision of advice to those detained in immigration removal centres), Freedman J also held that the policy, as amended following the determination in <span style="text-decoration:underline">FB</span>, was not unlawful ([2019] EWHC 2391 (Admin)).  In this appeal, the Appellants submit that both the tribunal and court were wrong to hold that the policy does not unlawfully restrict access to justice. </p>

The current process for enforcing removal can be complex, with a series of decisions having to be made in order to end the migrant’s leave and make a separate removal decision, with a further decision to set removal directions at a later date.  This complexity creates an unnecessarily bureaucratic process for caseworkers and enforcement officers and leads to delays in enforcing immigration laws as the three stages attract a separate right of appeal, an opportunity for legal challenge or both. </p>

The single decision will also advise the migrant that they must tell us immediately of any reasons why they should not be removed, e.g. on the grounds of an asylum or human rights claim. Reducing the process to a single decision and placing the onus on the individual to raise any human rights issues means that migrants will not be left in limbo and must take active steps to regularise their stay or depart.  Bringing human rights challenges forward will help ensure that any issues are addressed before enforcement action commences. </p>

Given that liability to removal under section 10 is crucially dependent upon immigration status, it is implicit in section 10 as enacted that an irregular migrant must have an appropriate opportunity to show that that he is entitled to remain in the UK, on whatever basis, prior to being removed.  Whether the policy under challenge adequately gives such an opportunity is at the heart of this appeal.  </p>

Focusing upon the category of people who require leave to enter or remain but do not have it, these provisions are generally concerned with determining, conclusively and without undue delay, those who are entitled to leave and those who are not; whilst giving an irregular migrant sufficient opportunity to challenge any adverse decisions before a court or tribunal prior to actual removal. </p>

Where a right of appeal is recognised, then removal does not take place until the appeal is finally determined.

Removal is so often by air that, for the purposes of this judgment, other modes of travel can be ignored (although generally the same principles and practice apply).   The arrangements needed for any enforced removal are often extensive, and include arranging travel documents and a place on a commercial flight or charter plane.  They frequently involve the person’s prior detention.  Where those arrangements have to be cancelled (e.g. because of late representations, claim or injunction), substantial cost and delay are incurred; and the migrant may have to be released from detention pending removal whilst the representations and any subsequent claim are considered. </p>

For the present appeal, it is sufficient to say that, there was a period when the Secretary of State would defer removal directions on the mere threat of a judicial review; but in many cases proceedings were never subsequently issued, so that irregular migrants effectively had a right of veto against removal, even if they had no real claim to entitlement to leave to enter or remain.  The policy was consequently changed so that the Secretary of State would defer removal only if and when a judicial review claim had been issued (as evidenced by an Administrative Court case number) and she had received the grounds of challenge.   </p>

The Secretary of State’s initial proposal was to have a period of only 48 hours, which, she considered, was “the minimum necessary [to enable the individual] to obtain legal advice and lodge a claim”.  That rightly acknowledged that most irregular migrants would require legal assistance to formulate submissions and make a legal claim in respect of their removal and any underlying issues; and also that, following a negative decision relating to removal, the policy had to give an irregular migrant sufficient time to instruct legal representatives and for them to make submissions to the Secretary of State and, if necessary, prepare and issue a claim for judicial review. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">It was eventually agreed that, if the minimum period between the setting of removal directions and actual removal as identified in those directions was 72 hours, the Civil Procedure Rules would be amended to require full grounds to be lodged with any judicial review claim.  It was thought that that would (i) give a sufficient period for a judicial review challenging the decision to issue removal directions and/or any underlying decision to be prepared with full grounds, and issued; and (ii) enable the court to deal with the issue of permission to proceed on an expedited basis – within days – which would mean that the Secretary of State could maintain the irregular migrant in detention until the application for permission was disposed of, and removal directions could then be reset promptly if permission was refused.

These exceptions were successfully challenged in the 2010 <span style="text-decoration:underline">Medical Justice</span> case (in which Silber J was upheld by this court: [2011] EWCA Civ 1710 (“the 2010 <span style="text-decoration:underline">Medical Justice</span> case (CA)”); and were then abandoned.

Versions 18 to 20 (the current version) have required removal directions (rather than a removal window) to be set, following the Order of Walker J dated 14 March 2019 in the Medical Justice claim in which, when granting permission to proceed with the claim, he imposed an interim injunction on removal without removal directions (with the caveat that, in respect of removal by charter flight, notice of the time of the flight need not be given), which is still in place.

It is said to be suitable for persons being removed under section 10 and persons being deported, and appears to be the default for such persons.  (The argument before us focused upon notice of removal window in section 10 cases, as will this judgment: but similar notices in deportation cases do not raise any significantly different issues.)  When such a notice is given, it starts “the notice period” during which the person cannot be removed, which is normally 72 hours (including at least two working days), but seven calendar days if the person is not detained and five working days in third country and NSA cases.  During the notice period, although a person remains “liable to removal” under section 10, he or she is not at risk of removal.  From the end of the notice period, the person is both liable to removal and also at actual risk of removal.  “The removal window” begins when the notice period ends, but it runs for three months from the date of notice of removal.  As the JRI Policy (at page 11) makes clear, although still not having leave to enter or remain and thus remaining liable for removal under section 10: “When a removal window has expired without the person leaving the UK in that time, any further proposal to enforce removal will require a new notice of removal with a  completely new notice period”. </p>

I should say that paragraph 3(ii) of the Respondent’s Note on Access to Justice dated 9 July 2020 (“Removal directions are only set if there are no outstanding representations, applications or appeals”, which seems to reflect the AR Policy (at page 8)) does not necessarily assist in this regard; because it refers to <span style="font-style:italic">setting</span> removal <span style="font-style:italic">directions</span> rather than <span style="font-style:italic">notifying</span> a removal <span style="font-style:italic">window</span>.  But, for my part, I am prepared to accept at face value the Secretary of State’s assurance set out in paragraph 3(i) of that same Note that: “A section 10 notice is served only after the caseworker has checked that there are no outstanding representations, applications or appeals”, i.e. that a notice of removal window will not be served if any representations are outstanding, even if the Secretary of State has not yet made a decision as to whether they amount to a fresh claim.  That is consistent with (i) paragraph 353A of the Immigration Rules (see paragraph 22 above), and (ii) the LAR Policy (at page 28), which provides that a Form RED.0001 (which is the main form used to notify a removal window: see paragraphs 50-51 below) must not be used where the relevant person “has a pending application…”.

Reasons for that decision are then given, followed by a section headed “Liability for removal”, under which the effect of section 10 is briefly set out and it is said: “If you do not leave the United Kingdom as required you will be liable to enforced removal to [country]”.  Notice of removal is then given.  Where removal directions are to be given, the form of words used is: “You will be given further notice of when you will be removed”.  When a removal window is given, the following form of words used: “You will not be removed before [date and time].  After this time, and for up to three months from the date of this notice, you may be removed without further notice”.

Mr Kovats submitted that they were written in simple, plain English; and they should be readily understandable by a lay person.  Subject to the important caveat that for most migrants English is not their first language and many do not have a good understanding of English, I agree.  For example, the Form RED.0001 makes clear both the consequences of not leaving the UK and the obligation promptly to provide any grounds upon which the individual claims entitlement to leave to remain; and gives unequivocal advice that the individual should seek any legal advice immediately.  It is therefore uncontroversial that (i) the forms are clear, in this sense; but (ii) an irregular migrant is likely to require assistance from a legal representative to respond to such a notice.  </p>

I will come to the Appellants’ detailed grounds of challenge shortly; but, in brief, leaving aside FB’s individual claim, the Appellants’ claim is a systemic challenge to the JRI Policy.  It is made on the basis that the Policy is inherently defective because many decisions which bear upon the question of whether an individual who has been served with a notice of removal window is entitled to leave to enter or remain will inevitably be made after the close of the notice period and in the removal window; with the result that, as soon as an adverse decision is made, he or she is at risk of immediate removal without any opportunity to challenge that decision by way of judicial review.  Therefore, on the Appellants’ case, the risk that the right to access to justice is compromised arises inherently from the Policy as it is intended to operate: it is not dependent upon the number of cases in which individuals have been (or may, in the future, be) denied access to justice in fact.   </p>

That is a vital building block of her submission that it is inherent in the scheme that the right to access to justice will be unlawfully restricted.  Decisions material to removal include not only (i) substantive but unappealable decisions on the immigration status of the person, but also (ii) decisions that deny the person an appeal at all (e.g. a decision that representations do not amount to a fresh claim for the purposes of paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules: see paragraph 22 above) or deny him or her an in-country appeal (e.g. a decision to certify a human rights or protection claim as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the 2002 Act: see paragraph 17 above), and (iii) decisions not to extend, cancel or defer the removal window or suspend removal (see paragraphs 44-49 above).        </p>

The Detention Services Order 06/2013: Reception, Induction and Discharge Checklist and Supplementary Guidance (“DSO 06/2013”) requires the IRC Supplier Induction Officer to explain to a new detainee on arrival (with an appropriate interpreter, if necessary) both the DSA scheme and his or her entitlement to contact an existing legal representative (paragraphs 25-29 of, and paragraphs 1, 4, 12 and 19 of Annex D and Annex E to, DSO 06/2013); and it normally requires a further induction session with the Home Office Immigration Enforcement Team, including an explanation of access to legal aid, within 48 hours (paragraph 30 of DSO 06/2013).  Although there are exceptions (e.g. where a detainee has already instructed a solicitor who happens to be one of the duty solicitors), legal advice is obtained by booking a DSA scheme appointment slot.  The purpose of the first session is to ascertain the basic facts of the matter, to decide whether action can be taken or whether the matter requires further investigation and, on the basis of financial information taken from the detainee and the merits, whether he or she is entitled to legal aid (paragraphs 30-59, referring to paragraph 8.34 of the Standard Civil Contract Specification – Category Specific Rules: Immigration and Asylum).  In response to a disclosure request on 10 May 2019 (“the SSHD Disclosure Response”), the Secretary of State disclosed (as Annex 11.2) evidence of the length of time a detainee would have to wait for a DSA surgery appointment: generally, this was 3-4 days, although at Yarl’s Wood IRC less (usually the next day) and Morton Hall IRC slightly more (but no more than a week and often less). </p>

However, (i) in some circumstances (the details of which are unnecessary to explore for the purposes of this appeal), an application for Legal Representation has to be made to the Legal Aid Agency, and (ii) where the matter falls outside the scope of usual legal aid (e.g. a claim on the basis of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right (“ECHR”)), it is expected that the detainee will make representations without legal assistance unless the claim is so complex that he or she cannot properly do so and an application for Exceptional Cases Funding is then made (paragraphs 40-46).

Similarly, where requests are made by such a person to extend, cancel or defer the window, or to suspend removal, any decision adverse to the individual is almost always going to be made in the removal window period; and, once it is made and served, it will put the individual at immediate risk of removal.

The case studies and other evidence suggest that many are not in fact removed, because (e.g.) they obtain legal advice and make an application to the court before they are in fact removed, or removal does not happen because of reasons other than legal proceedings (e.g. a medical condition, or by cancellation of the removal by the destination country, or as a result of disruption by the person to be removed).  </p>

In the case of C10, in which details were given by the Secretary of State as part of disclosure, further submissions for leave on protection grounds were refused as a fresh claim on the day of removal, and deferral was refused just five hours before C10 was removed to Bangladesh.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">First, Mr Kovats submitted that, as there is never a legal bar or impediment to an irregular migrant who is served with a notice of removal window seeking redress from the courts, this is essentially a rationality claim; and, in considering rationality, it is legitimate to balance the public interest in having a coherent and enforceable scheme to remove irregular migrants who do not have any right to be in the UK on the one hand, and the rights and interests of those migrants on the other.  It is in the public interest for irregular migrants to be required to make promptly any claim for leave to remain that they may have: late claims are potentially wasteful of time, effort and public money.  It is therefore legitimate to take into account opportunities that any particular irregular migrant has had to regularise his immigration status before any notice of removal is served on him – most, Mr Kovats submits, have had more than a reasonable opportunity to put forward any claim for leave they may have, as exemplified by some of the case studies – and also the opportunity they will have to challenge the lawfulness of their removal, after the event, from abroad.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">As a strand of that argument, Mr Kovats submitted that the evidence adduced by the Appellants did not show that there is any restriction of access to justice in more than a very few cases.  In the case studies, although the relevant individuals may have been at risk of removal prior to any legal challenge they could mount, in fact they made such a challenge (and were thus able to access justice) prior to their removal.  The Secretary of State has identified only eight cases in the period 2015 to 2019 (in which over 40,000 returns were effected) where she has brought back an irregular migrant removed from the UK and either she (or the court) has later determined that that person has a legal basis to remain in the UK or there are still ongoing proceedings (Annex 12 to the SSHD Disclosure Response).  Even in those cases, it was submitted that access to justice was not denied: the individuals had obtained access to justice after removal.  In cases identified by the Appellants, from their own case studies or from cases disclosed by the Secretary of State (in, e.g., caseworker training materials), Mr Kovats and Ms Rhee submitted that removal occurred because of caseworker error rather than any systemic defect.  The fewness and nature of these cases, coupled with the availability of redress from the courts after removal, undermined any submission that there was a systemic defect with the JRI Policy.        </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, as before Freedman J, in respect of an irregular migrant who is served with a notice of removal window, Mr Kovats relied upon the ability to apply to the Secretary of State for deferral of the removal window to show that the scheme, as a whole, does not deny access to justice and is procedurally fair.  As I have described, the JRI Policy specifically requires caseworkers to consider deferring the removal window when “during the notice period, an unrepresented person is yet to instruct a legal representative” (see paragraph 47 above); and there is no doubt that the Secretary of State, acting through caseworkers, has a discretion to defer a removal window wherever appropriate and particularly (as the Policy itself says) where deferral is necessary to ensure that “the person has had a reasonable opportunity to access legal advice and recourse to the courts” (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>).  Freedman J considered (at [196] of his judgment) that “deferral enables the risk of unfairness to be reduced”; and, further, “it is capable of being controlled by judicial review, so that those caseworkers who operate [it] know that they are answerable for their actions”.  Thus, “the policy regarding deferral provides some inbuilt flexibility into the system on which the [Secretary of State] relies”.  In terms of data, in the period 25 May 2018 to 9 March 2019, caseworkers considered deferring a removal window in 71 cases, initiated either on the caseworker’s own initiative or on request; and, of those cases, deferral was granted in thirteen.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Three further points in respect of deferral requests are worthy of note at this stage. First, as Ms Kilroy emphasised, requests for deferral are not encouraged: there is no reference to the possibility of deferral because of insufficient time to seek advice, relevant documents etc in any of the RED forms or in the material for IRC detainee induction.  Second, as with substantive leave decisions without a right of administrative review or appeal, once an adverse decision on a deferral request is made and served, the individual is at immediate risk of removal.  Third, as I have already described, a refusal of a request for deferral can only be challenged by way of judicial review.   </p>

For example, whilst paragraph 19(1) of Schedule 1 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 provides for legal aid to be available for civil legal services provided in relation to judicial review claims, paragraph 19(6) excludes “services provided in relation to judicial review of removal directions” where the directions are given no more than one year after the making of the decision to remove by way of removal directions or the negative conclusion of any appeal against that decision.  “Removal directions” are defined in paragraph 10(10) to include “directions… under section 10…”.  Similarly, section 24A of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she secures or seeks to secure “the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action against him”, and subsection (2)(a) includes, within the definition of “enforcement action”, “the giving of directions for his removal from the United Kingdom under… section 10…”.  These statutory provisions therefore recognise the legal importance of, not liability to removal, but the act of removal itself; and the necessity of making a decision to remove and giving the affected person notice of that decision. </p>

However, as I have described (paragraphs 50-51 above), the form is headed “Notice of Removal” (not “Notice of Liability for Removal”); and it gives not only notice of liability to removal but also, discretely, notice of removal in the form of a notice of a removal window in which the Secretary of State intends and expects removal will take place.  Although, in respect of the removal window period, it uses the phrase “you <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be removed without further notice” (emphasis added), that merely reflects the wording of section 10.  It clearly indicates an intention on the part of the Secretary of State to remove the person in that period.  The JRI Policy read as a whole makes that clear.  For example, a removal window period can be extended for 28 days, but only “where removal within that period is expected” (see paragraph 45 above).   </p>

In those cases, it is submitted, in breach of the right to access to justice, there is a serious risk of the individual being removed before the affected individual is able to access the court to challenge the decision.     </p>

For FB, it is submitted that the tribunal erred in proceeding on the basis that section 10 permits the abrogation of, or the imposition of hindrances to the enjoyment of, the right to access to justice (FB Ground 3); whilst, for Medical Justice, it is submitted that the serious risk of removal before the affected individual is able to access the court to challenge the decision that is inherent in the JRI Policy amounts to an unacceptable risk of a breach of the right to access to justice at common law which renders the Policy <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> (Medical Justice Ground 1), but also irrational given that it is the express aim of the Policy to maintain the right to access to justice by giving every person served with a notice of removal window sufficient time to raise a claim and for such a claim to be properly considered (Medical Justice Ground 2).  Furthermore, whenever such a decision is made in the context of (i) Dublin III, and/or (ii) Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (“the Qualification Directive”) and Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (“the Procedures Directive”) (together, “the European Directives”), and/or (iii) the ECHR, it is unlawful as failing to acknowledge the rights to legal advice and/or an effective remedy under those instruments (Medical Justice Ground 3). </p>

Parliament exists primarily in order to make laws for society in this country.  Democratic procedures exist primarily in order to ensure that the Parliament which makes those laws includes Members of Parliament who are chosen by the people of this country and are accountable to them. Courts exist in order to ensure that the laws made by Parliament, and the common law created by the courts themselves, are applied and enforced.  That role includes ensuring that the executive branch of government carries out its functions in accordance with the law.  In order for the courts to perform that role, people must in principle have unimpeded access to them.  Without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade…”. </p>

Rather, it is her case that the JRI Policy does not involve any such restriction.

Although Ms Naik submitted that it was unreasonable to withhold the details of removal, in my view, there is nothing arguably wrong as a matter of principle with such a policy, which can be justified on the ground that it is in the public interest to have an effective and efficient system for removing irregular migrants who have no right to be in the UK.   </p>

The receipt of the notice will therefore be the first trigger for any, or any further, representations.  Consequently, the Policy will inevitably lead to more postnotice representations that will require a decision by the Secretary of State than would otherwise be the case.

The courts have given guidance to legal representatives emphasising their professional obligations to take steps to challenge removal as early as possible, and with maximum notice to the Secretary of State (<span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Madan) v Secretary of State for the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Home Department (Practice Note)</span> [2007] EWCA Civ 770; [2007] 1 WLR 2891, <span style="text-decoration:underline">R</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">(Hamid) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2012] EWHC 3070; [2013] CP Rep 6 and <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (SB) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Practice Note)</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 215; [2018] 1 WLR 4457).

Even in cases to which we were referred in which, the court found, the Secretary of State had deliberately notified a material decision (e.g. to give notice of removal directions, or to refuse to defer directions which had been set) at a time when the courts would not be open prior to the actual removal, the legal representatives had nevertheless made an out-of-hours application and removal had been prevented (<span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Collaku) v Secretary of State for the</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Home Department</span> [2005] EWHC 2855 (Admin) and <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Karas and Miladinovic v</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2006] EWHC 747 (Admin)).

The ECtHR emphasised that article 13, as well as article 6, is an absolute right in this sense: it does not allow for the right to access to the court to be balanced against (and possibly outweighed by) the risk of abuse of process or overloading the court, but rather imposes on Contracting States “the duty to organise their judicial systems in a such a way that their courts can meet its requirements” (see [84]).   </p>

The relevant rights under the Refugee Convention and the ECHR are unqualified and it does not seem to us that it would be open to a Contracting State or, domestically, a public authority to seek to justify infringing them on the basis of the public interest in deterring abuse of process in the courts.

It is that which the tribunal considered was authorised by section 10.  On its face, that appears to be no more than the trite proposition that an irregular migrant’s ability in practice to access a court may be reduced as the time for removal approaches, e.g. when he or she is in the plane on the runway ready for take-off, or even on the way to the airport at a time when he or she may not have ready access to a telephone. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">However, in my view, the broader submission has substantial weight.  As I have described, although the court may summarily refuse an application that removal be stayed on the grounds that it could and should have been made earlier and is thus an abuse of the process, the right to access the court is an absolute and inviolable right, subject only to the inevitable practical constraints to which I have referred.  The UK’s obligation not to remove an irregular migrant where to do so would result in a risk to him or her of treatment contrary to article 2 and/or 3 of the ECHR and/or the Refugee Convention and European Directives has been expressly held by this court to remain binding until the moment of return (<span style="text-decoration:underline">R v Secretary of State ex parte Onibiyo</span> [1996] QB 768 at page 781E-G per Sir Thomas Bingham MR giving the judgment of the court).  It seems to me that that is clearly so.  But, in any event, the right to access to the court is not a relative right to be balanced against other rights and interests, the convenience of the executive or the courts, or the risks of abuse of process.  As much as the right to an effective remedy under article 13 of the ECHR (see <span style="text-decoration:underline">Čonka</span> at paragraph 106 above), the common law right to access to justice is not susceptible to being outweighed by factors such as other rights and interests, the convenience of the executive or the courts and the risks of abuse of process.  To the extent that the tribunal (see, e.g., [163] of its determination) or Freedman J (see, e.g., [220]-[222] of his judgment) considered such an exercise legitimate, I disagree.  The court must organise its systems in such a way that it can meet the requirement for an effective remedy, no matter when and the circumstances in which an application to prevent removal on the grounds of unlawfulness is made.  As I have indicated, there is no suggestion in this appeal that the court does not organise itself in such a way.  The question in this appeal is whether the Secretary of State, through the JRI Policy, has organised her systems to the same effect. </p>

In respect of that category of people, this court held that it was sufficient for the claimant to show that the policy abrogated the right of access to the court to challenge the lawfulness of removal by showing that the policy gave insufficient time between notice of removal and the removal itself to enable a legal adviser to be instructed and thereafter to challenge the lawfulness of the removal directions. </p>

Essentially, Ms Kilroy submitted that, so far as those in respect of whom notice of removal is in the form of a notice of a removal window are concerned, the abrogation of the right to access to justice in the JRI Policy is materially indistinguishable from the defect identified in the 2010 <span style="text-decoration:underline">Medical Justice</span> case as it then applied to those who fell within an exemption to the 72 hours’ notice requirement.  The right is infringed because, following an adverse decision material to their removal which is notified in the removal window, like those who fell within an exemption, as a result of the Policy itself, those involved are at risk of removal without any opportunity to challenge the relevant decision in a court or tribunal, i.e. they are at real risk of effectively being prevented from having access to justice.  As I have described (paragraph 61 above), the evidence clearly shows that almost all decisions material to removal which are made in respect of applications and representations made following service of the notice of the removal window are made within the window period itself.  As the unfairness is inherent in the Policy itself, Ms Kilroy submitted that the focus of the tribunal and (particularly) Freedman J on the case studies and evidence of numbers of cases in which an irregular migrant’s access to justice had in fact been interfered with was misplaced.  I agree. </p>

I accept that there is a legitimate public interest in encouraging irregular migrants to make any claim for leave to enter or remain that they may have promptly and to discourage late claims (see paragraph 100 above): but (i) whilst the failure to take earlier opportunities to make such a claim may be relevant to the question of whether the court should grant or refuse interim relief, it cannot restrict access to the court (see paragraph 104 above), and (ii) unless sanctioned by Parliament, the right to access to justice cannot be ousted by other rights and interests, the convenience of the executive or the courts/tribunals, or the risks of abuse of process (see paragraph 117 above).   </p>

The Secretary of State herself recognises in the JRI Policy that access to justice prior to removal may be important if not imperative: the reason why she set the periods between notification and the risk of removal as she did was to enable access to the court prior to the risk of removal arising (see paragraphs 29-31 above).  Whilst I accept that the opportunity to challenge underlying decisions relating to leave to enter or remain, and the lawfulness of the removal, out-of-country following removal is a factor which the court can take into account in deciding whether interim relief should be granted, it is not a factor that bears on the issue of access to the court prior to removal.  A migrant must be entitled to access to a court prior to removal, if only to contend that out-of-country proceedings would be ineffective in his or her case; although, for the reasons I have already given, it is open to the court to conclude that the Secretary of State was not legally obliged to consider very late, lengthy submissions prior to removal and/or that any form of interim relief is not appropriate.  </p>

For example, once removed, an irregular migrant may be “lost”; and continued, effective legal representation may be difficult, and the individual may lose the ability to give oral evidence which might be crucial.  Furthermore, unlike <span style="text-decoration:underline">Kiarie</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">and Byndloss</span> (an article 8 claim) and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Ahsan</span> (a claim for indefinite leave to remain, refused as a result of the Secretary of State suspecting dishonesty), notice of removal in the form of a removal window is used in cases where the irregular migrant contends that removal will subject him or her to treatment contrary to article 2 and/or 3 of the ECHR and/or the Refugee Convention.  Therefore, the consequences of an unlawful removal may be grave, and irremediable after the event.  Subject always to Parliamentary intervention, it is the role of the court (and not of the executive) to balance such factors against the public interest in having an effective and efficient immigration system including an effective and efficient scheme for removing those who have no right to be in the UK. </p>

He said (at [196]) that “deferral enables the risk of unfairness to be reduced”; and “it is capable of being controlled by judicial review, so that those caseworkers who operate [it] know that they are answerable for their actions”.  Thus, “the policy regarding deferral provides some inbuilt flexibility into the system on which the [Secretary of State] relies”.  This was equally the thrust of Mr Kovats’ submissions to us. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, the fatal flaw in Mr Kovats’ submissions (and in the analysis of both the tribunal and Freedman J) on this issue is that an irregular migrant who applies for deferral (or, I should add, extension, cancellation or suspension of the window: see paragraphs 44-48 above) and is refused within the removal window – as will almost always be the case – will be at immediate risk of removal without having had an opportunity of challenging the refusal in a claim for judicial review (supported by an application for interim relief) before a court or tribunal.  For the reasons I have given, contrary to Freedman J’s conclusion, judicial review is not in practice immediately available to challenge a decision of the Secretary of State material to removal (including a decision not to defer etc) prior to the relevant person being at risk of immediate removal without further notice.  There is, at that point, a real risk of denial of access to justice.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, Mr Kovats submitted that the point was undermined by the fact that in most cases the individual will not, in fact, be removed prior either to having that opportunity or to the removal being cancelled or deferred because of some extraneous reason, such as ill-health.  However, the fact that many irregular migrants in these circumstances are not removed is not as a result of the JRI Policy, which puts them at the immediate risk I have identified; it is despite that Policy.  On the basis that the Secretary of State does not deliberately delay notifying decisions until immediately prior to removal is due to take place (and, as I understood the submissions, no party suggested that she now does: although see paragraph 105 as to previous practice), whether an irregular migrant is removed before he or she has had an opportunity to obtain legal advice and apply to the court is a matter of pure happenchance.  It is, in the legal sense, arbitrary and thus in any event unlawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Third and finally, Mr Kovats submitted that notice of removal in the form of a removal window leaves the relevant person in no worse position than if given 72 hours’ notice of removal directions with a fixed date and time, and the Appellants do not argue that such notice is unlawful.  However, unless accepting that it would be appropriate and necessary for any person served with a notice of removal by way of removal window to issue judicial review proceedings – which he did not expressly accept, and which would be contrary to the intention of the Policy to reduce appeals and save costs (see paragraph 12 above) – I do not see any force in this submission.  In practice, there is a significant difference; because, where the irregular migrant knows the date and time of his or her removal, that focuses not only his mind, but also the minds of both his legal representatives and the Secretary of State.  It is noteworthy that (i) although the Secretary of State responds to representations within hours if removal directions have been set, it takes weeks or even months when they have not been set (see paragraph 59(v) above), and (ii) the Secretary of State does not suggest that, as a result of the Policy, every irregular migrant served with notice of a removal window who may wish to make representations should issue a protective claim and application for interim relief to be considered by the court prior to expiry of the notice period.  As I have said, that would be contrary to the express aim of the Policy to save costs. </p>

As Hickinbottom LJ explains at [74]-[87], there is no legal basis for either submission.  An irregular migrant in receipt of the Notice of Removal, in RED.0001 form, will know that, if he or she does not take their own steps to leave the UK, they will be removed during the removal window period.  That is sufficient.  There is no right to another notice giving details of how and when the Secretary of State will remove that individual if he or she refuses to leave of their own volition. </p>

In my view, that submission is contrary to the JRI Policy itself (which appears to recognise expressly the importance of access to the court prior to removal). Moreover, although I consider that the practical problems that affect such out-of-country challenges were perhaps over-stated by the Appellants, I respectfully agree with the Lord Chief Justice’s analysis at [196]-[199] below, that there are readily identifiable categories of case where the harm might be irredeemable.  </p>

Late claims raised shortly before the known date of removal have been endemic, many fanciful or entirely false.  Whilst there is no suggestion of any such conduct in these proceedings, it is a matter of regret that a minority of lawyers have lent their professional weight and support to vexatious representations and abusive late legal challenges.  The courts have developed controls which provide some protection for its own processes and for the proper functioning of immigration control (e.g. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Madan</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Hamid</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">SB</span>, cited at paragraph 104 above); but the practical and administrative problems for the Home Office in dealing at speed with<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>substantial new representations in the days and hours leading up to a removal are legion.

The policy has been subject to many revisions and updates.  As Hickinbottom LJ has explained fully, the practice of giving notice of removal directions, was later discontinued.  Instead, an irregular migrant would be given a notice which explained that he had no right to remain in the United Kingdom, with accompanying reasons, and encouraging immediate representations if the migrant disagreed.  To that end, the policy created the dual concepts of a notice period (which mirrored the old periods of the 2007 policy, amended to take account of the successful 2010 challenge) and a removal window of three months which followed immediately upon the notice period.  Nobody would be removed within the notice period but might be removed without further notice during the currency of the removal window.  </p>

That conclusion follows from the consensus underlying this appeal that those periods, whilst tight, do not deny a migrant a reasonable opportunity to challenge the decision to remove of which he has been notified.  The essential problem identified by the Appellants was that the version of the policy with which we have been concerned enables a migrant to raise new arguments within the time scale of the initial notice period, but for a decision to be made in the removal window and removal to follow so quickly that there is no opportunity for an in-country challenge in cases where the right to access to justice includes the right to mount such a challenge. </p>

Its operation so far as removal windows was concerned was then suspended in these proceedings in the limited respect described by Hickinbottom LJ in paragraph 37 above.  Of those 40,000, the Secretary of State has identified eight individuals who were removed but were returned either because a court ordered return, or the Secretary of State later recognised their right to be in the United Kingdom.  The various solicitors who have given evidence of their experience have identified about 20 individuals who would have been removed but as a result of prompt action were protected.  That illuminates the risk, but does not help to establish how many it might apply to. There is some evidence of individuals being removed very promptly following adverse decisions.  What is missing from the evidence is any indication of the numbers of migrants who were removed more quickly after an adverse decision than the equivalent times used for the notice period (72 hours or five or seven days as the case may be).  That information would provide a more reliable estimate of those who were likely to have had too little time to get advice and challenge the decision before removal, although not, of course, the numbers of those who would have done so.  </p>

The Lord Chancellor contended that, in the absence of distinct proof of individuals who had been prevented by fees from bringing claims, the Fees Order could not be unlawful.  He relied upon fee remission for those of very limited means together with a residual discretion to remit fees.  He argued that those who did not bring proceedings were making choices about how to spend their money.  In the context of fees, at [91], Lord Reed explained that “in order for the fees to be lawful, they have to be set at a level that everyone can afford, taking into account the availability of full or partial remission.”  The evidence was not conclusive in demonstrating that the fees had prevented people from bringing claims, but conclusive evidence was not required.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">The Appellants’ core submission on this point is that the JRI Policy inevitably results in many decisions which bear upon the question whether an individual served with a notice of removal window is entitled to leave to enter or to remain being made during the removal window.  The result is that removal is possible without any opportunity to challenge the decision.  </p>

In the latter case, any difficulties in accessing justice arise from the migrants’ own choice not to do anything promptly.  Whilst, for the reasons set out in Hickinbottom LJ’s judgment at paragraph 102, that does not impact on the migrants’ legal right to access the court, in those circumstances <span style="font-style:italic">the policy</span> has not in any way impeded the migrants’ ability to make fresh representations or challenge a relevant decision.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Like Hickinbottom and Coulson LJJ, I consider that whilst in many cases the safeguards built into the policy go some way towards avoiding the risk of peremptory removal without a realistic chance of challenging an adverse decision made during the removal window, they do not meet the central vice of denial of access to justice before removal of a readily identifiable subset of irregular migrants.  Between paragraphs 44 and 47 above, Hickinbottom LJ considers four aspects of the policy itself which are prayed in aid by the Secretary of State.  In their various ways, they are concerned with circumstances in which removal will be deferred, or the notice period or removal window extended, to enable representations to be considered or to facilitate an opportunity for a migrant to take advice or challenge a decision.  But none meets the distinct problem identified in this appeal.  There is no general requirement to delay removal in cases within the three categories I have identified to provide an opportunity to seek advice and make a challenge.   </p>

The Appellants cite <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Kiarie and</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Byndloss) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2017] UKSC 42; [2017] 1 WLR 2380 in support of a broad proposition that out-of-country appeals or judicial review claims are inadequate for the purposes of satisfying access to justice.  That is not what the Supreme Court held nor a correct proposition of law.  The Supreme Court was faced with two fact-specific cases in which two foreign nationals convicted of serious criminal offences were subject to deportation.  Each relied upon article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the ECHR”) and their private and family life to argue that their deportation would violate Convention rights.  They raised an issue under the procedural obligations which attach to article 8 resulting from the legislative regime requiring them to pursue their appeals from abroad.  There were questions concerning certification under section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">The practical consequences of having to pursue an appeal from abroad were considered by Lord Wilson beginning at [60] of his judgment (three other members of the court agreed with his reasoning).  It was an appeal heard in February 2017 in the Supreme Court and in September 2015 in the Court of Appeal.  It considered the practical and technological arrangements available at that time.  Even so, as Lord Wilson explained at [67] in connection with giving evidence from abroad, “it might well be enough to render the appeal effective for the purposes of article 8, provided only that the appellant’s opportunity to give evidence in that way is open to him.”  The focus was on giving oral evidence.  Plainly, that will rarely be a consideration in judicial review claims.   The consideration of the practicalities that followed were rooted in the technology available to and used both by the First-tier Tribunal and appellants.   In the intervening years both have been transformed and their use has become ubiquitous in courts and tribunals the world over, a process accelerated by the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic which has swept around the globe since the beginning of this year.  Lord Wilson discussed the cost of hiring video conference rooms and equipment, for example, which have long ago become an irrelevance in holding online video meetings. From the point of view of a litigant, whether discussing a case with legal representatives, attending a hearing or giving evidence all that is required is video enabled device attached to the internet, with widely available commercial software installed in it.  The position in courts and tribunals is entirely different from how it was even three or four years ago.    </p>

Practical arrangements for hearings from abroad bore upon the procedural aspect.  It is clear from both the judgment of Lord Wilson and, for example, [103] of the judgment of Lord Carnwath that the conclusions were dependent on evidence of the practical arrangements available when the Secretary of State made the original decision in connection with the two appellants.  There was material in an agreed note that had been placed before the Court of Appeal and further evidence before the Supreme Court to which he refers at [85].  Whilst agreeing with the result in the cases before the Supreme Court Lord Carnwath said (at [103]): </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.00in">Nonetheless, that does not provide a complete answer to this aspect of the appeal.   Whilst it is true that the ability to challenge a decision from abroad will mean that there is no unlawful impediment to access to justice in many cases, there are readily identifiable classes of case where that will not be so.  The most obvious are those where removal itself exposes the migrant to immediate risk of harm; cases raising articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR or under the Refugee Convention, for example.  Like Lord Wilson and Lord Carnwath, I do not consider that the same is true as a matter of principle in article 8 cases. </p>

The protection of a right of access to justice does not entail anything so impractical.  Examples were given in paras 72 and 73 of <span style="text-decoration:underline">SB</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>of circumstances where the Secretary of State would not be obliged to defer removal to consider very late representations and, as I have explained, a distinction must be drawn between the operation of the policy and the lack of action by a migrant. </p>
