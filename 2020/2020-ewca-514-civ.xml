The Respondent considered the Appellant’s application by reference to the requirements for leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM RLTRP.  As the Appellant could not meet all the requirements of Section E-LTRP, the Respondent considered the application by reference to the requirements of para. ELTRP 1.1(a), (b) and (d).  The Respondent was not satisfied that the requirements of paragraph EX.1 were met by the Appellant as: (i) there was no evidence of insurmountable obstacles preventing the Appellant and her partner from continuing their relationship in Bangladesh; and (ii) there were no exceptional circumstances which, consistent with the right to respect for private and family life contained in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”), might warrant the grant of leave to remain outside the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">When the Appellant’s underlying appeal came before the UT, the DUTJ first considered whether the Appellant met the requirements of para. 276ADE and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  As the Appellant had remained unlawfully in the UK, she could not satisfy the immigration status requirements set out in appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Therefore the DUTJ considered para. EX.1 and found that the Appellant was unable to establish that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life between the Appellant and her partner continuing outside the UK.  On the question whether it would be “reasonable” to expect the children to leave the UK, the DUTJ considered the test outlined in <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria) and Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2018] UKSC 53; [2018] 1 WLR 5273, at para. 19, citing <span style="font-style:italic">EV (Philippines) and Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 874, at para. 58, where it was said by Lewison LJ that a “real world” view must be taken.  The DUTJ concluded that, in this case, where there were no insurmountable obstacles to family life between the Appellant and her husband continuing outside the UK, the natural expectation would be that the children, aged 3 and 3 months respectively, would go with them and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that this would not be reasonable. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the human rights claim on Article 8 grounds, the DUTJ applied the approach set out by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] UKHL 27; [2004] 2 AC 368.  It was held that Article 8 was engaged and the DUTJ moved to consider whether the interference was in accordance with the law and necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country.  The primary issue was whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved.  As required by section 117A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”), as amended by the Immigration Act 2014, the DUTJ had regard to the considerations listed in section 117B.  Having taken all the evidence into account, it was held that the refusal of leave to remain was proportionate to the legitimate aim of enforcing immigration control. The Appellant’s appeal was therefore dismissed.  </p>

It is argued that the DUTJ fell into error in failing to establish the context in which to make the reasonableness assessment under section 117B(6).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context, we heard interesting submissions from the parties as to whether there is scope for Article 8 to play a part in cases where section 117B(6) arises.  Mr Anderson submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that there is a residual scope for Article 8 to apply.  This is because he submits that, although section 117B(6) is a “freestanding” provision (see <span style="font-style:italic">KO</span>, at para. 17), that does not mean that it is exhaustive of the scope of Article 8.  He submits that section 117B(6) is to be regarded as a benevolent provision, which can only operate in one way, potentially in favour of an appellant but never adversely to an appellant.  I would accept Mr Anderson’s submission in this regard.  It seems to me both to be right in principle and also to be consistent with the analysis of section 117B(6) given by Elias LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">MA (Pakistan)</span>, at para. 17, where he said that that subsection “must be read as a self-contained provision in the sense that Parliament has stipulated that where the conditions specified in the subsection are satisfied, the public interest will not justify removal.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is important because a conventional Article 8(2) inquiry can take into account, as part of the overall proportionality exercise, other public interest considerations, including the conduct of the parent or parents.  Under section 117B(6) there is no room for such an inquiry to take account of the conduct of the parents: that is the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span>, which overruled the earlier decision of this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">MM (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 617; [2016] Imm AR 954 and in that respect approved what had been said by Elias LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">MA (Pakistan)</span> (as that case was known before it became <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria)</span> when it went to the Supreme Court), at para. 36.  Under section 117B(6) the only question is focussed on the child: would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?  If the answer to that is No, there is no need to go on to consider Article 8(2) more generally.  However, as a matter of principle, and as Mr Anderson rightly submitted, if the answer is Yes, there will still be a residual scope for Article 8(2) to be considered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The next submission made by Mr Biggs in support of his “categorical” or “hypothetical” approach was that otherwise a tribunal would be compelled to undertake a very difficult factual analysis, which would be contrary to the underlying purpose of section 117B.  However, as Mr Anderson pointed out, in Article 8(2) cases more generally, such difficult questions can arise and tribunals do have to face up to them.  He reminded us in that context of what was said by Sedley LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">VW (Uganda) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 5, at para. 42.  As Baker LJ observed during the course of the hearing before us, similar questions can arise in family proceedings under the Hague Convention.  Although a provision such as section 117B(6) reduces the scope for judicial evaluation which may be necessary, it does not eradicate it completely.  Where necessary, and depending on the facts, judges can and do ask questions which may call for a difficult evaluation.  That could include asking the question what is going to happen to the family unit if one parent has the right to remain in the UK and the other does not.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, in this context, Mr Biggs placed reliance on what was said by the Upper Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">Patel (British citizen child – deportation) </span>[2020] UKUT 45 (IAC).  I observe, however, that that was a decision on section 117C(5), a provision which was said by the Upper Tribunal to call for a hypothetical question to be answered: see para. 32 of the judgment.  In my respectful view, that does not assist the Court in determining the issue which arises on the present appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I would therefore reject Mr Biggs’s primary submission as to the interpretation of section 117B(6).  I would, however, accept his alternative submission, that the provision calls for a fact-finding exercise so that the full background facts must be established against which the only statutory question posed by that provision can then be addressed.  I would emphasise again, as the Supreme Court did in <span style="font-style:italic">KO (Nigeria) </span>and this Court did in <span style="font-style:italic">MA (Pakistan) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">AB (Jamaica) </span>that, once all the relevant facts have been found, the only question which arises under section 117(6)(b) is whether or not it would be reasonable to expect the <span style="font-style:italic">child</span> to leave the UK.

That would be so even in an ordinary Article 8 case: see <span style="font-style:italic">GM</span> at paras. 42-52, in particular paras. 43-44 (Green LJ).  That is all the more so in a case which is not a conventional Article 8(2) one but arises under section 117B(6). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Anderson submitted that, applying the correct approach to that provision, the UT did not fall into error.  He submitted that, in substance, the UT had properly addressed the question which it had to in accordance with that provision and, on the basis of the limited evidence which the Appellant had chosen to place before it, despite the opportunity to adduce further evidence before the UT, the DUTJ was entitled to reach the conclusion which he did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not accept those submissions.  In my judgement, the UT did fall into error as a matter of approach.  This is illustrated in particular by what was said at paras. 26 and 27 of the judgment.  At para. 26 the DUTJ said that: “There is no evidence before me to suggest that the appellant’s partner would be unable to cope alone with the children, with the support of his family, if they chose to remain in the UK.”  At para. 27, he said: “… I should consider whether it is reasonable for the children to live in the UK with their father, or live with the appellant and her husband as a family unit.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In those passages the DUTJ appeared to contemplate the possibility of two alternatives arising on the facts.  The first was that the entire family unit would go overseas.  The other scenario, however, was that the children would remain in the UK only with their British citizen father and that the Appellant would leave the UK.  If those facts were to arise, there would inevitably be a disruption of the family unit.  This would be contrary to the best interests of the children.  The DUTJ appeared to ask the question whether it would be reasonable for the children to remain with their British citizen father in the UK.  This is why he asked such questions as whether he could cope with bringing them up, with the support of family here.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgement, that was fundamentally the wrong approach under section 117B(6), which poses the question whether it would be reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK.  That is not, as Mr Biggs submitted, a hypothetical question but it is a normative question, not merely an exercise in prediction: see <span style="font-style:italic">AB (Jamaica)</span>, at paras. 73-75 (Singh LJ), approving what was said by UTJ Plimmer in <span style="font-style:italic">SR (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] UKUT 334 (IAC), at para. 51; and see also <span style="font-style:italic">AB (Jamaica)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>at para. 116 (Underhill LJ). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, I would accept Mr Biggs’s submission that the UT wrongly focussed on the question whether there would be “insurmountable obstacles” to the maintenance of the family unit outside the UK: see in particular para. 27 of the judgment.  This was contrary to what is required even in an ordinary Article 8(2) case as made clear by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">GM</span>, drawing on long established Strasbourg caselaw.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this context, Mr Biggs made a number of submissions, in particular in his supplementary skeleton argument and at the oral hearing, to which objection was taken on procedural grounds by Mr Anderson.  Mr Anderson submitted that the grounds on which permission to appeal had been granted were limited and that this line of argument inadmissibly sought to widen those grounds.  In my view, that is not the case.  The reason why Mr Biggs drew attention to the fact that various facts were never found, such as what would happen to the family unit given that one of the parents is a British citizen and has lived all his life in the UK, is that it illustrated the fundamental error of approach which the UT adopted in this case.  It was not in itself a freestanding ground of appeal which Mr Biggs was seeking to raise despite having no permission to do so. </p>

In those circumstances, I would remit this case to the appropriate tribunal for reconsideration in accordance with the judgments of this Court.  The parties are agreed, in the circumstances which have arisen, that this case should be remitted to the FTT rather than the UT.   </p>
