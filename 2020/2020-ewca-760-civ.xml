This is one of a number of self-contained flats in a block of flats owned by the claimant, Trecarrell House Limited.  The Flat is provided with central heating and hot water by means of a gas boiler which is housed elsewhere in the building.  There are no gas pipes or gas appliances within the Flat itself. </p>

It is common ground that it created an assured shorthold tenancy (“AST”) to which the provisions of s.21 of the Housing Act 1988 (“HA 1988”) apply.  Under s.21(1) the landlord may obtain possession of premises let on an AST simply by giving to the tenant at least two months’ notice in writing stating that he requires possession.  When that is done the Court must make an order for possession.  It is not necessary for the landlord to rely on and establish one of the grounds for possession set out in Schedule 2 to HA 1988 nor does the Court have to be satisfied that it is reasonable to make the order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, the claimant served a s.21 notice on Ms. Rouncefield on 1 May 2018.  At the time when the tenancy was granted in February 2017 Ms. Rouncefield was not provided with a copy of the relevant gas safety record (“GSR”) nor had the claimant taken advantage of regulation 36(7) by displaying a copy of the GSR in some prominent position in the premises.  But the claimant had provided Ms. Rouncefield with a copy of the GSR on 9 November 2017.  This was a GSR dated 31 January 2017.  Although it was the current GSR at the date of the grant and commencement of the tenancy, it was obviously out of date by the time that the s.21 notice came to be served.  The trial was conducted under the accelerated procedure for claims made under s.21 HA 1988.  As a result, there were no formal pleadings as such but in her defence form Ms. Rouncefield took a number of points including that the 2017 GSR had not been provided prior to her taking up occupation of the Flat as required under regulation 36(6)(b).  Reference is also made to a further GSR dated 3 April 2018 (stating that the check had been carried out on that date) which was provided to Ms. Rouncefield shortly after that date.  On that basis, there was a period of over 14 months between inspections rather than the 12 months specified by regulation 36(3)(a).  The landlord now contends that the second GSR gave the wrong date for the check and that it was carried out on 2 February 2018.  There was no check carried out on 3 April 2018 and the GSR provided which bears that date was simply a document generated in error by the claimant’s computer system.  The claimant has produced a GSR relating to the inspection on 2 February 2018, although there is an issue as to whether this was provided to Ms. Rouncefield prior to the service of the s.21 notice on 1 May 2018.

In such circumstances, the Flat is served directly or indirectly by the gas boiler so as to make the boiler a “relevant gas fitting” for the purpose of regulation 36(2) and therefore subject to the obligation to carry out and make a record of an annual inspection under regulation 36(3).

Regulation 2(1) of the 2015 Regulations clearly identifies both paragraph (6) and paragraph (7) of regulation 36 as prescribed requirements for the purposes of s.21A HA 1988.  But the scope of regulation 2(2) is more controversial and has given rise to a number of issues of interpretation.  In this case the landlord has contended that the effect of regulation 2(2) is not merely to remove the 28 day period in regulation 36(6)(a) for the purpose of its treatment as a prescribed requirement but also to make compliance with regulation 36(6)(b) not dependent on the GSR being provided to the tenant or displayed prior to occupation.  In the course of his submissions on this appeal Mr Bates developed an alternative argument that regulation 2(2) had the effect of excluding paragraph (6)(b) in its entirety.  The reference to the requirement prescribed by paragraph 1(b) (of the 2015 Regulations) being “<span style="text-decoration:underline">limited to</span> the requirement on a landlord to give a copy of the relevant record to the tenant and the 28 day period for compliance with <span style="text-decoration:underline">that</span> requirement does not apply” (my emphasis) means, he said, that it includes only regulation 36(6)(a) (minus the 28 days) as a prescribed requirement because paragraph (6)(b) does not contain a requirement to provide the GSR within 28 days.  </p>

He considered that the words I have quoted did no more than to remove from regulation 36(6)(a) the requirement to provide the GSR to an existing tenant within 28 days but that it left intact both paragraph (6)(b) and (7) as prescribed requirements for the purposes of s.21A.  His view was that the exclusion of paragraph (6)(b) as a prescribed requirement was both inconsistent with the purpose of ensuring that all tenants, both existing and prospective, should have the assurance of living in a safe environment and was too drastic a construction of the words used given the blanket inclusion in regulation 2(1) of the whole of both paragraph (6) and paragraph (7) of regulation 36.  If the intention had been to exclude paragraph (6)(b) in its entirety one would have expected to see that expressed by its omission from regulation 2(1).  As it is, regulation 2(2) can be read simply as the identification of the 28 day requirement in paragraph (6)(a) and the exclusion of that alone from the general effect of regulation 2(1). </p>

In my judgment, my interpretation, as indeed that of DJ Bloom, who I uphold on this point, gives effect to those regulations. It controls the landlord's ability to give notice under Section 21 to those circumstances in which assurance has been given to the occupier that premises are safe. It will be recalled that the Gas Safety Regulations require such assurance, not only to tenants, but also to prospective tenants. My reading of regulation 2(2) gives effect to the purpose of the 2015 Regulations, in that it ensures, consistently with the intention of the (earlier) Gas Safety Regulations, that landlords must give the requisite assurance to tenants before they take up their tenancies and that once such assurance has been given, they must repeat such assurance on a recurrent basis, by giving later copies of certificates, or records. The tenant in the latter case, that is to say, in relation to a post-tenancy inspection check, need only be given such assurance at some time before the service of the notice.  </p>

He also submits that the conclusion in both <span style="font-style:italic">Caridon</span> and this case that a failure to comply strictly with regulation 36(b)(b) and (7) excludes the service of a s.21 notice for all time cannot be justified by or based simply on a consideration of the meaning and effect of the 1998 and the 2015 Regulations.  The scheme of the legislation introduced by ss. 38 and 39 of the DA 2015 is, he says, to qualify by primary legislation the ability of the landlord to terminate an AST by the service of a s.21 notice.  The 2015 Regulations perform the function of identifying which provisions of other primary and subordinate legislation constitute prescribed requirements for the purposes of s.21A but they do not contain any provisions which determine the consequences of a breach of a prescribed requirement.  That depends upon reading and applying the provisions of the designated legislation in accordance with the provisions of s.21A itself.  A landlord may not serve and rely on a s.21 notice “at a time when .. [he] .. is in breach of a prescribed requirement”.  The issue therefore in every case is whether a breach of the prescribed requirement continues and in the case of an historic breach whether the words “at a time when” in s.21A have the effect of permitting late compliance with an obligation which under the prescribed requirement has (as in this case) to be performed by a particular time.  </p>

The effect of regulation 2(1)(b) is to make the whole of paragraphs (6) and (7) prescribed requirements for the purposes of s.21A HA 1988.  Regulation 2(2) is a qualification of that provision and clearly excludes the 28 day period mandated under paragraph 6(a).  Late compliance with the landlord’s obligation to provide or display a GSR after each annual check is not therefore a bar in itself to a subsequent s.21 notice.  However, the argument that regulation 2(2) also obviates any requirement for the landlord to comply with paragraph (6)(b) as a prescribed requirement faces at least two obvious difficulties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first is that such a construction of regulation 2(2) makes no obvious sense in terms of the policy behind regulation 2(2).  It is difficult to see any reason why Parliament should have chosen to require compliance with paragraph (6)(a) for existing tenants but to have deliberately excluded as a prescribed requirement the equivalent protection for new tenants provided for by paragraph 6(b).  The second objection to this construction of regulation 2(2) is that it is an unlikely way of drafting the regulation if the intention was to include only paragraph (6)(a) in a modified form.  One would have expected regulation 2(1)(b) to have identified only paragraph (6)(a) and (7) rather than to have included the whole of both paragraphs and then left the somewhat cryptic provisions of regulation 2(2) to be read as excluding paragraph (6)(b) in its entirety.  It seems to me that the more obvious construction of regulation 2(2) is that it relates back to regulation 2(1)(b) which specifies paragraph 6 as a composite provision without distinguishing between sub-paragraphs (a) and (b).  The reference in regulation 2(2) to “the requirements prescribed by paragraph (1)(b)” is therefore one to paragraph 6 as a whole and so when it says that the prescribed requirement is “limited to the requirement on a landlord to give a copy of the relevant record to the tenant” it is referring to that obligation as it appears both in paragraph (6)(a) and in paragraph (6)(b) but to that obligation alone.  The effect therefore of regulation 2(2) is to remove the 28 day time limit in paragraph (6)(a) and arguably also the requirement in paragraph (6)(b) that a new tenant should be supplied with a copy of the current GSR prior to taking up occupation.  The obligation uplifted by regulation 2(1)(b) is (as the words in parenthesis indicate) no more than the obligation to provide the tenant with the relevant GSR.  I will return to that point in a moment.  But, in my view, for the purposes of s.21A, the prescribed requirement applies to both types of tenant.  I do not accept that paragraph (6)(b) is excluded in its entirety.   </p>

As with any other health and safety regulations, a breach of the 1998 Regulations is punishable as a criminal offence under s.33 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and a landlord whose breach of the regulations results in the death of a tenant may also have a potential criminal liability for manslaughter.  The imposition by s.21A of a bar to the service of a s.21 notice is therefore only collateral to these sanctions and, at best, a spur to compliance.  It has, in my view, to be read and interpreted in that context.  The clear exclusion of the 28 day requirement from paragraph 6(a) confirms that Parliament did not intend regulation 36(6) and (7) as prescribed requirements to be applied with the same vigour as the regulations themselves.  That also supports, in my view, the construction of regulation 2(2) as excluding from regulation 36(6) not only the 28 day provision in paragraph (6)(a) but also the requirement in paragraph (6)(b) that the GSR should be provided to a new tenant or displayed prior to the tenant going into occupation.   </p>

The purpose and intended effect of the embargo will therefore vary from case to case depending upon the provisions of the legislation in question.  So, for example, in a case where a landlord takes a deposit from a tenant without giving the tenant the prescribed information as defined within the 30 day period allowed or without arranging for the deposit to be held in accordance with an authorised tenancy deposit scheme no s.21 notice may be given until the prescribed information is provided or the deposit is returned: see Housing Act 2004 ss.213(5), 215(1), (2) and (2A).

If a breach has the consequence for which Mr Cherry contends then that must apply in every case of late delivery even if the delay is only minimal.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This argument is put on two bases.  The first is that the next gas safety inspection due after 31 January 2017 took place more than 12 months after the previous inspection.  The claimant originally contended that it took place on 3 April 2018 but now says that this was an error and that the inspection in fact took place on 2 February 2018.  Even on that basis there was a breach of regulation 36(3)(a) which requires safety checks to be carried out at intervals of not more than 12 months.  The provision of a GSR based on a late inspection means, says Mr Cherry, that as at 1 May 2018 there was also a breach of paragraph (6)(a) and (7) because the second GSR was not a copy of the record “made pursuant to the requirements of paragraph 3(c) above”.  This is because paragraph 3(c) imposes on the landlord an obligation to ensure that a record in respect of any gas appliance “so checked” is made and retained and the words “so checked” must refer back to paragraph 3(a) which requires each appliance to be checked for safety at least every 12 months.  In this way, it is said, the requirement for 12 monthly checks is imported as part of paragraph (6)(a).   </p>

It had therefore been supplied within the 28 days provided for under paragraph (6)(a).

As Mr Bates submitted, paragraph (3)(a) is not itself a prescribed requirement and if the words “so checked” in paragraph (3)(c) are read in the sense for which Mr Cherry contends then the landlord would have no obligation under paragraph (3)(c) to make and retain a copy of any late inspection nor would regulation 36(5) be workable.

The obligation imposed on the landlord by paragraph (6)(a) is to give the existing tenants a copy of a GSR which contains all the information specified in paragraph (3)(c).  The April 2018 GSR was not such a document because it did not give the correct date of the safety check.  It cannot therefore be relied upon by the claimant as evidence of compliance with paragraph (6)(a) as a prescribed requirement.  The GSR relating to the February 2018 safety check does contain all the information required under paragraph (3)(c) but there is an issue as to when it was served on Ms. Rouncefield.  If it was not served on her until after she had received the s.21 notice then the claimant is prevented by s.21A from relying upon that notice.   </p>

If she received it before or with the s.21 notice then the claimant’s appeal must be allowed.  If she received it after service of the s.21 notice then the appeal must be dismissed for that reason alone.  This Court is not in the position to determine this issue of service.  If the other members of the Court are in agreement, I would therefore remit that issue for determination by the County Court under CPR 52.20(2)(b).  Once the County Court has decided when Ms. Rouncefield first received the February 2018 GSR we will make an order disposing of the appeal in whatever way is appropriate. </p>

As Patten LJ sets out in paragraph 24, there are other, criminal, sanctions for breaches of the 1998 Regulations.  However, the sanction imposed by s.21A in respect of the “safety of occupiers of dwelling-houses”, of depriving a landlord of the ability to take advantage of the accelerated possession procedure, might be expected, in my view, to impose a substantive sanction rather than simply a procedural requirement to give a GSR to a tenant at any time prior to the provision of a s.21 notice.  In saying this, I recognise that I have to address the effect of regulation 2(2) on paragraph (6)(a) of regulation 36 (which I deal with below).  I also recognise that, as set out in an Agreed Note provided by counsel after the conclusion of the hearing, it appears that all the other prescribed requirements are capable of being remedied at any time save for that set out in s.213(3) HA 2004 (in respect of which there is an express statutory alternative remedy, as set out below).  However, this is largely because many of them have no date for compliance and, significantly, none of them are directly addressing the safety of occupiers of the property.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The legislative framework is set out in Patten LJ’s judgment.  As he notes in paragraph 7, the provisions of s.21A and the 2015 Regulations place additional pressure upon and provide encouragement for landlords to comply with regulation 36 by imposing the sanction of being unable to rely on the accelerated possession procedure provided by s.21 “at a time when the landlord is in breach of a prescribed requirement”. </p>

These and other provisions in HA 2004 and the Deregulation Act 2015 were not referred to by counsel in their written arguments.  However, during the course of the hearing they were asked to provide an agreed note of other provisions which restrict a landlord’s right to serve a notice under s.21 HA 1988.  In their Agreed Note, as I understand it, counsel agree that the combined effect of s.213(3) and s.215(1A) HA 2004 is that no s.21 notice can be served if the landlord has failed to comply in time with the requirements in respect of a deposit set out in s.213(3). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I have spent some time dealing with these provisions because, in my view, they support Patten LJ’s conclusion in paragraph 29, with which I agree, that s.21A does not mean that all the prescribed requirements must be remediable.  They show that the words, “at a time when”, in s.21A are not limited to breaches which are remediable but can also refer to a breach which is, in itself, irremediable.  I agree with Patten LJ that the words “at a time when”, on which Mr Bates has based his submission, do not mean, let alone require, that the underlying requirements must be interpreted so as to have the “ambulatory” effect for which Mr Bates contends, namely that the prescribed requirements are to be interpreted as being remediable.  As Patten LJ says, the question of whether a breach of one of the prescribed requirements is or is not remediable must be determined principally by reference to the terms of the requirement itself, although also having regard to the legislative scheme as a whole. </p>

Regulation 2(1)(b) refers to paragraphs (6) and (7) and I can see no reason for interpreting this as meaning only paragraph 6(a).  Further, as Patten LJ say, in paragraph 19, if the intention had been to include only paragraph 6(a), and not (6)(b), there would have been a more direct and obvious way of drafting this provision to make that clear than by including it in regulation 2(1)(b) only to exclude it in regulation 2(2). </p>

This clearly has the effect of turning the provisions of paragraph (6)(a) into what I have called a procedural rather than a substantive hurdle and limiting their effect as a sanction. </p>

Patten LJ concludes that it applies also to paragraph 6(b) for the reasons he gives in paragraphs 20 to 24 and 30.  The conundrum in this case arises, in my view, from the fact that regulation 36(6) contains two separate obligations in (a) and (b), only one of which has a “28 day period for compliance” as referred to in regulation 2(2). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I acknowledge the force of the points made by Patten LJ.  Why, as he asks, should there be a disparity of treatment between the provisions of paragraph 6(a) and (b) for the purposes of s.21A?  Mr Cherry suggested that it could be because of the need to ensure that the safety of a new tenant was protected from the commencement of his occupation and so that the tenant was aware of the next date when the next safety check was due.  These are possible reasons for differentiating between a tenant going into occupation and a tenant in occupation.  It is not very satisfactory to come up with no clear answer but, in my view, putting it the other way round, no reasons have been identified, either by reference to principles of statutory interpretation or otherwise why, what I regard to be, the effect of regulation 2(2) on a plain reading should not be applied. </p>

But that, in my view, is the combined effect of paragraph (6)(b) and regulation 2(2) and nothing in the wording of s.21A or the scheme of the legislation require or provide a sound basis for reaching a different conclusion.  Indeed, if the time requirements in both paragraphs (6)(a) and (6)(b) were lifted, then I do not see these provisions as imposing much of a sanction at all.  Finally, although this is a somewhat circular argument, I would add to what HHJ Luba QC said in <span style="font-style:italic">Caridon</span>, at [43], and note that, as an alternative, the legislation could have provided a means by which a landlord could avoid the effect of having failed to comply with paragraph (6)(b), as was done in s.215(2A) HA 2004, but it does not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The other issue was also, as I understand it, a new argument which was not advanced below.  It is a pure question of law, namely whether a landlord can only comply with paragraphs (6) and (7) of regulation 36 if the GSR provided to the tenant or displayed is a GSR in respect of a safety check which has been carried out within the time limits stipulated in regulation 36, namely within 12 months of installation or the previous check (as amended by regulation 36A inserted on 6 April 2018).  For the reasons set out by Patten LJ (in paragraph 35), it is difficult to see how regulation 36 would be workable if this argument was right.  However, as this was not raised below and was, with respect to counsel, argued as a subsidiary point, and given its importance I would prefer to wait until it is properly and substantively raised and argued before finally deciding the point. </p>
