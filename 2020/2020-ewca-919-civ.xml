	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Grounds of Appeal in this case were settled in August 2018, and therefore prior to this court’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">R (Faqiri) v Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Chamber)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 151, in which it was determined that an order for costs could be made in favour of a successful claimant in CPR r 54.7A proceedings against the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“SSHD”) even though he was not a Defendant but an “interested” party who had not actively participated in the proceedings. The issues in the instant appeal appeared to be mostly on all fours.  Consequently, it was initially difficult to see why the appeal was not compromised; indeed, the Respondent’s Notice filed in September 2019, suggested that an order for costs be made in the same terms as the order endorsed by the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Faqiri.</span>  However, the Appellant, by Mr Westgate QC and Mr Draycott, dismisses the proffered solution as a worthless outcome in this particular case, (now long since resolved as indicated below), and likely to be made in error in similar cases in the future, by virtue of a jurisdictional elephant trap, which issue was not fully argued before the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Faqiri</span> he says.   The SSHD by Miss Giovannetti QC and Mr Joseph, disputes that there is any jurisdictional impediment to the type of contingent costs order made in <span style="font-style:italic">Faqiri</span>, which effectively provided for ‘costs in the appeal.’  Background. </p>

He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) which, on 3 May 2016, allowed his HP claim related to the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip but rejected his asylum claim based on his alleged inability to return there. Both parties applied for permission to appeal (“PTA”): A challenging the rejection of his asylum claim; the SSHD challenging the finding of A’s HP claim.   </p>

On 24 June 2016, A applied to the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) for permission to rely upon amended and extended grounds of appeal.  On 26 July 2016, the application was refused by UT Judge Gleeson who considered that “<span style="font-style:italic">the proposed amended grounds … are neither of substantial assistance to the Tribunal nor in line with the over-riding objective</span>”. </p>

However, in this case my instructions are not to lodge an Acknowledgment of Service and to allow the Court to consider the matter without one. This is because my client considers that the law in this area is settled by the case of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cart -v- Upper Tribunal [20111 UKSC 28</span>. I understand that if the Court takes the view that it would be assisted by a detailed response from the Secretary of State it will contact GLD requesting that the Secretary of State provide an acknowledgment of Service before considering the question of permission and I therefore reserve the right to lodge such an acknowledgment at a future date should the need arise'.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 2 February 2017, Gilbart J refused permission, stating that it was “entirely within the UTJ’s discretion in terms of her case management powers to decline to permit the amendment.”  A appealed.  Sales LJ, as he then was, granted permission to appeal against the Admin Crt’s refusal to grant permission to issue JR proceedings on 28 December 2017, subsequently amended on 23 March 2018 to add the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) &amp; anr as Respondent for SSHD. Sales LJ identified an important point of principle, namely that a lesser standard of proof should have been applied in A’s asylum claim, and may consequently lead to a different outcome. The grant required that the parties should promptly invite the Admin Crt to consider assigning the claim for JR to UT with a view to the claim being heard together with the appeal for which permission had already been granted, on a “rolled up basis” with the appeal to follow in the event that the UT decided that the previous refusal of the UT for PTA on this part of the case should be quashed<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">.  </span></p>

In that case an issue relevant to possession proceedings commenced in the county court was transferred to the FTT. The FTT decision was appealed to the UT. Thereafter, the issue being resolved in the defendant’s favour, the claim resumed in the county court and, by consent, the claim for possession was dismissed. The defendants sought to include the costs of the tribunal hearings as “of and incidental to” the county court proceedings. The judge ruled that s 51(3) SCA did not encompass the costs of that part of the claim dealt with in the FTT as “incidental to” the associated proceedings in the County Court, since the discretion of the court was limited to the civil division of the Court of Appeal, High Court, family court or county court.   Mr Westgate also draws comparison with the situation in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Darroch v FA Premier League Ltd</span> (2017) 4 WLR 6, and the obiter reasoning of Burnett LJ, as he then was, in confirming the Divisional Court’s refusal of civil costs in relation to a criminal matter, otherwise governed by a different costs regime.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Clearly, at the point when the Admin Crt considers orders pursuant to CPR 54.7(9), the successful claimant has established that there is an arguable case, which has a reasonable prospect of success, that the decision of the UT refusing PTA and the decision of the FTT against which PTA was sought are wrong in law; and that the claim raises an important point of principle; or there is some other compelling reason to hear it. The grant of PTA has obviously involved a qualitative assessment of the chance of success in the appeal but is not determinative of successful outcome. Undoubtedly,<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> as can be seen from </span>the law reports, a significant number of appeals in the UT following JR proceedings fail. Therefore, if Mr Westgate’s argument that A, and other successful claimants, should be awarded their costs immediately upon securing PTA succeeds, there will be many compensated for achieving a Pyrrhic victory, namely the ability to prosecute an appeal which ultimately fails, or as in the<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Israr Shah v SSHD </span>[2018] UKUT 00051, as Lane J, President determined to have happened,  cases where the Admin Crt  had been persuaded to grant permission on a wrong basis. Therefore, I do not think that the claimant’s success at this stage of the proceedings, of itself, provides a principled basis upon which to base an order for costs. It may be different if SSHD unreasonably seeks and prosecutes a full hearing of the JR or is demonstrated to have misled the UT when considering the application for PTA. Otherwise, the “successful party” can only usually be identified once ultimate outcome, by order or compromise, is known. </p>

That is, if the application for permission is refused on paper, there is no right to seek an oral hearing CPR 54.12(3). However, the authorities dealing with the relevance of public funding in the context of applications for costs are clear, whilst sympathetic to the plight of publicly funded advocates and mindful of public interest,  </p>

However, for the reasons I give above, I consider that there is a jurisdictional bar to making this as a stand-alone order. Even if I am wrong as to the legitimacy of the contingent order in these circumstances, the operation of TP(UT)R 10 may thwart Admin Crt judicial intent that a successful claimant will at least receive the costs of the CPR 54.7A proceedings, although   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, the issue of costs, if not in one of those cases where an immediate order is warranted either way, should be transferred to the UT as JR proceedings so as not to fetter the discretion of either the Admin Crt or the UT. The exercise of judicial discretion under different costs regimes may still result in no order for costs of the CPR 54.7A proceedings being made to the successful claimant, dependent upon the circumstances which the UT will be far better placed to adjudicate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to the instant appeal, I have no doubt that the UT, or Admin Crt if a concession had been made soon enough by SSHD, would have been better placed to assess the merits of A’s costs of the CPR54.7 proceedings. Unfortunately, the end of proceedings far in excess of 1 month ago means that the UT is unable to make any order for costs, under either CPR or TP(UT)R.  (See TP(UT)R 10.6, at [17] above.) </p>

This court must therefore consider the question afresh. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal was compromised by mutual, albeit staggered withdrawal, and the status quo that existed at the conclusion of the hearing before the FTT prevails.  A has leave to remain. However, I agree with Mr Westgate that it was necessary for A to protect his position by appealing the lost asylum claim in view of SSHD’s appeal against the FTT’s recognition of his HP claim. Once the SSHD withdrew her appeal then it was not necessary to proceed with any part of the appeal. The SSHD could have accepted the FTT decision at any time after it was given. Had he/she done so then the CPR54.7A proceedings could have been avoided. A is the “successful party”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In seeking to support the terms of Moulder J’s order that there be no order for costs save legal aid detailed assessment, Miss Giovannetti relies on the fact that UTJ Gleeson did not see the need for expanded grounds of appeal, in relation to which the CPR54.7 proceedings were commenced, and regarded them as unnecessarily lengthy and confusing. However, objectively assessed at this remove, the reasons given by the single judge for the grant of PTA validate A’s stance. In those circumstances, I am not swayed by the argument that “even if A had followed the direction of Sales LJ and asked the Administrative Court to transfer the JR to the UT to be considered on a “rolled up” basis with the appeal, in the event that the refusal of PTA (or, to be precise permission to amend) was quashed it is reasonably clear that the UT would have been unlikely to make a costs order in A’s favour.” It is speculative. As previously indicated, if the JR proceedings had been transferred the CPR 44 costs regime would apply and is far more permissive than the TP(UT)R.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Miss Giovannetti also suggests it is “far from clear” that A had included all the relevant documentation in the JR bundle.  His JR grounds asserted that he had been refused PTA when in fact he had been refused permission to amend his grounds. Again, I am not swayed by these arguments. SSHD would have been served with the CPR54.7 documents, and if concerned at omissions was at liberty to file an Acknowledgment of Service or seek a hearing of the JR claim, but waited to raise it before the UT.  Nevertheless, I note that she relies on the inactivity of the SSHD as an Interested Party to suggest  it is not a straightforward case of identifying the SSHD as “<span style="font-style:italic">the unsuccessful party</span>” within the meaning of CPR 44.2.  </p>
