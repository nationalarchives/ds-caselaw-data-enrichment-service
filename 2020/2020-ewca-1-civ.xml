	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The decision was given effect by a direction under section 59A of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 (“SSPA 1975”). The effect of rule 10.2 of Section B of the BT Pension Scheme (“the BTPS”), which is the largest private sector funded occupational scheme in the country, was that the indexation for relevant members of the PCSPS (a pension scheme for civil servants) was carried across to relevant members of Section B of the BTPS (a private occupational pension scheme). The origins of rule 10.2 can be traced back to the separation of the Post Office from the rest of the civil service, well before the telecommunications business of the Post Office was moved to a new statutory corporation, British Telecommunications, whose business was privatised in 1984, when its assets and liabilities were transferred to BT. BT says that the Treasury’s decision for public service pensions will increase BT’s liabilities under the BTPS by approximately £120 million, unlike any of its competitors, even though that was not the intention behind the direction under section 59A. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">BT’s complaint is that the Treasury could and should have implemented indexation for members of the PCSPS in a way that would have avoided the knock-on effect of benefiting members of the BTPS under rule 10.2 of Section B of the BTPS. BT says that could have been done in one of various ways that had been suggested to the Treasury by BT. BT further contends that the reasons why the Treasury rejected BT’s suggestions were based on misunderstandings of the law, both in relation to the vires of the Government to do what BT suggested and as to whether the BTPS Section B members have a legitimate expectation, amounting to a property right protected by Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“A1P1”), that they will enjoy the same pension increases as are granted in the public sector under the various statutory provisions mentioned in rule 10.2, namely the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 (“PIA 1971”) and SSPA 1975 sections 59 and 59A (together “the Increases Legislation”). </p>

The Executive Summary stated that the outcome of the consultation was that the interim solution would be extended for a further two years and four months and that during that period the Government would investigate the possibility of conversion as an alternative, long-term methodology. BT’s position was considered. The consultation response said that the Government believed that it would not be appropriate to act in a way that would deprive members of indexation, to which they would otherwise be entitled. It said that acting to do so would also raise legal questions, including whether there was a legitimate aim to justify such an interference in the property rights of scheme members; and, in addition, some of the mechanisms suggested by BT to avoid the read across from public service schemes to BT’s private sector scheme were outside the scope of the Government’s statutory powers.  </p>

If the Government did so, the consequence would be that Section B members would not get the pension benefits which they would otherwise obtain.  The savings in pension payments which BT would achieve through crafting a solution to suit BT would necessarily be matched by the loss to Section B members of an equivalent amount in pension benefits.

The Court referred (at [158] – [161]) to the well established principle that statutory powers can only be used for the purpose for which they were conferred and not for some other purpose, including conferring private, collateral benefits upon third parties. The court said (at [163]) that in the present case BT was seeking the exercise of the general powers under SAA 1972 (to make and administer public service pension schemes) in order to pay indexation on GMP otherwise than by means of the Increases Legislation, not in the interests of civil service pensioners, but in the interests of BT in order to avoid it incurring a pension liability to its Section B members; and so compliance with BT’s request would entail using public powers conferred in relation to public service pension schemes in order to affect the provision of benefits under private pension schemes, and to do so to serve the financial interests of BT, in short to save BT money.

It said that the Government was keen to hear from such organisations and representatives of their scheme members and pension fund trustees, and that it wished to understand how their rules aligned to those of the public service pension schemes; whether the Government should take action to avoid a read across, and if so what specific actions they felt the Government could take to avoid direct implications for their pension schemes, including which policy options would be expected to directly require changes to such schemes. There then followed five specific questions relating to those issues, as follows: Question 12: “How could the delivery of any of the policies in the consultation impact wider public sector or private sector schemes who are not ‘official pensions’ under the PIA 1971”; Question 13: “If wider public sector or private sector schemes who are not ‘official pensions’ are impacted by any policy set out in the consultation, why were the pensions designed to mirror official pensions originally”; Question 14: “Should the government take action to avoid any read across between private sector schemes and any policy announced”; Question 15: “Are there actions the government could take to restrict the impact on wider public sector or private sector pension schemes who are not ‘official pensions’ under the PIA”; Question 16: “Why </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Advice by Freshfields to BT on the statutory override and its legal justification was annexed to BT’s consultation response. That advice was a lengthy and detailed document which explained how a statutory power could be introduced to modify the rules of affected private sector schemes, such as the BTPS, so as to change the requirements to provide increases on GMPs, overriding restrictions contained in section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995. The effect of that section is to prevent a power in a private occupational pension scheme being exercised by any person to modify the scheme in a manner that would or might affect any entitlement, or accrued right, of any member of the scheme save in certain specified circumstances. In the document Freshfields said that they considered that the pension benefits protected by section 67 would amount to a property right protected by A1P1 but that such interference could be legally justified as being in the public interest and proportionate. The document set out the basis for that view. In the course of Freshfields’ detailed explanation of those matters it was asserted (in paragraph 3.1) that “in order to ‘decouple’ the BTPS from the practices of the PCSPS in relation to the payment of increases on GMPs, it would be necessary to amend the relevant increases rules of the BTPS”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">On the face of it, BT’s consultation response was a clear and unequivocal statement, carefully crafted by it and its lawyers, that, if the Government adopted the PCSPS amendment option, the Government would also have to introduce a statutory override. The reason, also clearly articulated by BT’s lawyers, was that, if the PCSPS amendment stood alone, it would still be a complex legal question whether or not pension increases under the PCSPS would be read across to Section B members of the BTPS. Although not elaborated in BT’s consultation response, it seems likely, as Ms Demetriou explained, that the doubt and the complexity would arise from a variety of facts, including in particular the following. The pension increase rule (rule 13.2) in Section A of the BTPS is identical to the material part of rule 10.2 in Section B, and it is accepted by BT that a stand-alone amendment of the PCSPS would not prevent a read-across of increases to Section A of full indexation, albeit because (BT says) of the particular wording of rule 1 of Section A (which is not mirrored in Section B) that members would be paid the like superannuation benefits as the maximum benefits which could be paid to or in respect of such member under the enactments and instruments relating to superannuation in the Civil Service as varied from time to time. A number of former members of Section A have moved to Section B on the assurance, or at the least the understanding, that they would be in no worse a position and that in fact the move would be to their financial advantage. Further, some of those members would have been, or might have been, not merely employees of the Post Office, who received assurances about indexation of pensions at the time Section A was created in 1971 but also former civil servants, who received assurances about indexation of their pensions before the establishment of the Post Office in 1969.  </p>

She submitted that the Divisional Court was wrong not to have done so. That, however, is to underplay significantly the fact that BT’s consultation response was BT’s formal response to the Government's request to private sector pension schemes to inform the Government of their views on the various options put forward in the consultation and, in particular, to Questions 12-16 in the consultation, and the fact that it was a lengthy, detailed analysis prepared with obvious care by BT and its lawyers.  </p>

It was clearly put forward to Ministers on the face of both the October and the November Submissions. Neither of the Submissions rules this proposal out. Following the policy ‘steer’ provided by the Chief Secretary, HMT had no cause to advise on the feasibility of the PCSPS Workaround because Ministers did not wish to do anything actively to avoid the BTPS Read-Across. Were Ministers minded to offer BT a carve-out, HMT would have reviewed the PCSPS Workaround further (together with BT’s other proposals, and any other options which may have come to light).” </p>

While BT is correct that there is nothing in the pre-consultation material which indicates that BT was advancing the PCSPS amendment route only in conjunction with a statutory override, BT’s consultation response was, as we have said, based upon advice from and indeed in part written by BT’s lawyers and represented BT’s considered answer to the Government’s questions. The ordinary and natural meaning of BT’s consultation response is that it was putting forward the PCSPS amendment route in conjunction with a statutory override and not as a stand-alone option. The question currently under consideration is whether, in view of the postconsultation material as to the Treasury’s understanding of BT’s position, BT’s consultation response should not be interpreted in that way but rather in a way that aligns with BT’s current litigation stance that it always put forward the PCSPS amendment route as a stand-alone option. </p>

The third sentence of paragraph 3.19 of the Government’s January 2018 response, which is set out in [68] above, was referring to the legal questions raised by, among other things, a statutory override.

The email asked the Treasury, with reference to the third sentence of paragraph 3.19 of the Government’s formal response to the consultation, to set out its reasons for the Government’s rejection of Freshfield’s arguments in the annex to BT’s formal consultation response explaining why there was a legitimate aim for a statutory override which would interfere with scheme members’ property rights. There was no complaint in that email that there was no need to worry about “legal questions”, as mentioned in the third sentence of paragraph 3.19, as the PCSPS amendment route was a stand-alone option. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“You put forward several proposals” - expressed the PCSPS amendment route as a separate proposal from the statutory override. On the other hand, both the preceding paragraph and the subsequent paragraph are addressing what was regarded as a fundamental policy objection as well as an inevitable legal complexity, namely the interference with the BTPS members’ property rights caused by a statutory override. That perceived inevitability of legal complexity is made clear by the words – “There would in addition be legal issues” – in the final paragraph of the extract from the letter quoted above. Viewed in that way, the wording of the letter relied upon by Ms Rose, like the wording in paragraph 15 of the submission to the Chief Secretary dated 19 October 2017 and the wording in paragraph 12 of the submission to the Chief Secretary dated 23 November 2017 also relied upon by Ms Rose, is best seen as an enumeration of the different elements of the options presented by BT.

He does not say that it was put forward as a stand-alone “option”; and, for the reasons we have given above, the 23 November 2017 submission is more consistent with the conclusion that Officials were acting on the basis that the PCSPS amendment route was put forward by BT in conjunction with a statutory override and not as a stand-alone option. </p>

As we have said, in view of our decision on Appeal Ground 1, the Government was justified in being concerned about that matter as a statutory override was an integral part of that proposal, and it is common ground that a statutory override would indeed interfere with BTPS Section B members’ A1P1 rights. We consider, however, that, looking at the evidence as a whole, it is also clear that the Government’s decision was motivated by policy considerations which were divorced from <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> and A1P1 infringement concerns. </p>

One basic rationale of this ‘contracting out’ was that since members of a contracted out occupational pension scheme would receive benefits from their scheme largely equivalent to AP, there was no need for the members and the employer to pay National Insurance contributions so that the members received AP as well. By contracting out the employer and members received a rebate on their National Insurance contributions.

The result was that the AP element of their state pension was increased each year by an amount equivalent to the indexation of their GMP.
