The second is whether either or both discharged bankrupts in their capacity as trustees of a family trust or unsecured creditors in a compulsory winding up are persons “aggrieved” for the purposes of challenging the conduct of a liquidator under section 168(5) Insolvency Act 1986 and, accordingly, have standing to make an application under that sub-section.  </p>

Amongst other things, Mr and Mrs Brake sought to set aside a sale of certain interests in a property known as West Axnoller Cottage (the “Cottage”) and an adjoining strip of land, and have their bid for the Cottage, made in their capacity as trustees of the Brake Family Settlement (the “Settlement”), accepted instead of that of Chedington Court Estate Limited (“Chedington”), the only active Respondent in these appeals. Alternatively, they sought an order that the interests in the Cottage be sold under the direction of the court. Chedington’s ultimate owner is a Dr Geoffrey Guy (“Dr Guy”). The Brakes are the First and Second Appellants in both the Liquidation and the Bankruptcy Appeals in their capacity as trustees of the Settlement. They are Third and Fourth Appellants in the Bankruptcy Appeal, in their personal capacities. The Third – Seventh Appellants in the Liquidation Appeal, together referred to as the “Unsecured Creditors”, were joined as applicants in the Liquidation Application on 13 March 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These appeals arise against a very complex factual background in which there are a number of long running and hostile sets of proceedings between the parties (and between the Brakes and Dr Guy/Chedington, in particular) in relation to the ownership and occupation of the Cottage. The essential background details are as follows. In February 2010, seeking investment in their luxury holiday lettings and wedding venue business, the Brakes entered into the Partnership with Patley Wood Farm LLP (“PWF”), the investment vehicle of a Ms Brehme. In April 2010, the Cottage was acquired by the Partnership and registered in the names of the Brakes and Ms Brehme, who held it on trust for the Partnership. At that time, Mrs Brake was already the registered and beneficial owner of the adjoining strip of land, having purchased it in 2006. Disputes arose between the partners which were referred to arbitration.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In December 2012, whilst that arbitration was on foot, the Brakes issued separate proceedings in the High Court against Ms Brehme and PWF. As amended, the Brakes’ claim sought the transfer of the Cottage from the Partnership to the Brakes in their personal capacity, and included a claim in proprietary estoppel.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The arbitration concluded in 2013 with a final award in favour of PWF, a costs order against the Brakes and the dissolution of the Partnership.  In March 2015, having failed to pay the costs awarded in the arbitration, the Brakes were adjudicated bankrupt.  The Brakes’ interest in the Cottage (through their High Court claim) and Mrs Brake’s interest in the adjoining strip of land vested in Mr Swift as their trustee in bankruptcy. In May 2017 the Partnership was put into liquidation. </p>

The bids were required to be made by 21 December 2018 and were subject to certain conditions. Amongst other things, they were required to be made subject to contract only (conditional offers being prohibited) and needed to state the purchaser or vehicle by which the Cottage was to be acquired. Chedington submitted a bid of £500,000 (subject to conditions) on 20 December 2018, and the following day the Brakes (in their capacity as trustees of the Settlement) made a bid of £476,000 which has been described as a cash offer.   </p>

Instead, it is alleged that Mr Swift and Chedington secretly entered into an agreement in order to facilitate Chedington’s purchase of the Cottage. The terms of Mr Swift’s role in facilitating these transactions were set out in a letter of engagement from his firm (Moore Stephens (South) R&amp;I LLP) to Chedington dated 10 January 2019. This provided that Chedington would pay to Moore Stephens a sum of £4,000 (plus VAT) in legal costs and a further facilitation fee, comprising a one-off payment of £30,000 (excluding VAT) and a further £3,000 per month until full registration of the transfer of the Cottage to Chedington. Under this agreement, one third of the fee was to be made available to the creditors and two thirds was to be paid to the trustee in bankruptcy in respect of the time spent progressing the transactions.  </p>

It was common ground that this was not likely and as the Brakes had not pleaded fraud in the common law sense, the judge considered that they did not have standing.

See the Liquidation Judgment at [4], [7] - [8].  Further, he held that the fact that Mrs Brake’s son, purportedly a previous occupant of the Cottage, is a beneficiary of the Settlement did not assist the Brakes in establishing an interest, particularly as he is only a discretionary beneficiary.

If the Brakes were aggrieved by the manner in which the liquidators conducted the bidding process, other common law remedies were available to them; and no further protection should be awarded to outsiders to the liquidation simply because the offeror was a trustee in bankruptcy and therefore an officer of the court.

First, having quoted from the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mahomed</span> cases, the judge noted that Chedington submitted that the principles in those cases, which were concerned with challenges to the conduct of liquidators under section 168(5), applied equally to a trustee in bankruptcy under section 303(1). See [10] – [12] of the Bankruptcy Judgment. He went on to set out Chedington’s contention that the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Mahomed</span> cases were against the Brakes and that they had been merely denied the opportunity to acquire the Cottage and had no standing to complain about the conduct of the trustee in bankruptcy. See [14] of the Bankruptcy Judgment. Thereafter, he pointed out that it was important to distinguish between the Brakes in their personal capacities as bankrupts and in their capacity as trustees of the Settlement and noted that the bankrupts, as such, were not bidders.

That was a case in which the applicant company which was in liquidation was an unsecured creditor of the respondent company which was in administration. The companies entered into a claim determination deed pursuant to which the applicant’s claim as a creditor was agreed at £23.35m.  Due to a clerical error by the respondent’s administrators the figure was too low. Nevertheless, the deed was executed and the sum was paid before the error was noticed. The administrators acknowledged the error but relied upon a release clause in the deed to decline to correct it. The liquidators of the under-paid creditor company applied to the court for directions that the administrators increase the figure either under the court’s inherent jurisdiction to control the conduct of its officers or the court’s discretion under paragraph 74 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986. </p>

That is to be judged by the standard of the rightthinking person, representing the current view of society.

On the footing that the claims of secured creditors have been or will be satisfied, it is perfectly clear that unless and until there proves to be a surplus available for contributories (a most improbable event), ‘persons aggrieved’ must include the company’s unsecured creditors. If the liquidator disposes of an asset of the company at an undervalue, their interests are prejudiced and each of them can claim to be a person aggrieved by his act. Such was the position of the applicants here. Mr Rayner James submitted that they brought the application not as creditors but as persons who had not been given an opportunity to make an offer for the asset. In the latter capacity alone, like any other outsider to the liquidation, they would not have had the locus standi to apply under section 168(5).

The bankruptcy trustee applied for directions in relation to the disposal of the principal asset in the estate, which was a counterclaim in an action commenced against the bankrupt. It was clear that any realisation would be used to meet the petitioning creditor’s costs and legal costs, that the trustee in bankruptcy was not going to receive any settlement of his costs and that there was no prospect of any recovery for the creditors. The trustee in bankruptcy offered the counterclaim for assignment to the bankrupt and the claimant in the action and, ultimately, accepted the claimant’s bid.

The Serious Fraud Office was investigating the bankrupt’s affairs, and sought information from his trustee in bankruptcy, who authorised the applicant solicitor to provide all relevant documents to the SFO.  The bankrupt threatened proceedings against the former solicitor for any disclosure of privileged documents and so the latter sought directions from the court in respect of the trustee’s previous authorisation.

He noted that the statutory precursors to s.303(1) had referred to a person “aggrieved” rather than “dissatisfied” and held at 883 that “[I]t may be that no change of substance was intended by the change in wording, but ‘dissatisfied’ is certainly no narrower than ‘aggrieved’, and is arguably wider.”  The judge quoted from the Privy Council case <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General of the Gambia v N’Jie</span> [1961] 2 AC 617 at p.634, in which Lord Denning noted that the words “person aggrieved” were words of “wide import which should not be given a restrictive interpretation.

As Peter Gibson LJ put it in the <span style="font-style:italic">Mahomed</span> case, it could not have been the intention of Parliament that any outsider to the liquidation, dissatisfied with some act or decision of the liquidator, could attack that act or decision by the special procedure, </p>

That case was concerned with the restoration of a company to the register under section 1029(2) Companies Act 2006, and, in particular, with standing in relation to a restoration application.

Section 1029(2) sets out eleven categories of person who may apply for a restoration order, including a former member of the company ("former" because the company has been dissolved). In addition, it permits the application to be made by "any other person appearing to the court to have an interest in the matter" (emphasis added). A former member is, by virtue of that status alone, considered to be a person with a sufficient interest in the restoration of the company to be designated as a person who may make the application. If a restoration order is made, it will directly affect all the members. The company of which they were members will be revived and, if they were members at the date of dissolution, their status as such will also be revived. They will become again the owners of an asset, their shares in the company. . . They may indeed have many legitimate reasons to support or to oppose restoration. For the same reasons, it is clear that they are "directly affected" by a restoration order for the purposes of CPR 40.9 and so have standing to apply to the court to vary or set aside a restoration order.” </p>

The former members of a company are intimately and directly involved with whether it should be restored to the register. If it is restored, they become the owners of an asset once again. The position of bankrupts under section 303(1) is entirely different. As Harman J explained in the <span style="font-style:italic">Dodwell</span> case, as long ago as 1949, the bankruptcy regime is based upon the principle that “the bankrupt is relieved of his debts and freed from the oppression of his creditors, but at a price which is that he is stripped of all his property, that property vesting in a person who . . . has been described as the trustee.  . . . He is not a trustee of it for the bankrupt, but for the creditors, and the bankrupt till the bankruptcy process is worked </p>

As I have already mentioned, the judge relied upon the dicta in the <span style="font-style:italic">Deloitte</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Dodwell</span> cases to reach the conclusion that the Brakes had no standing under section 303(1) because, in addition to being named in the statute, there must be a surplus in the estate in order for a bankrupt to have a legitimate interest in the relief sought. Mr Davies submits that the judge was wrong to apply the dicta in those cases. As I have already mentioned, however, he impliedly accepted that something more than a mere status as a bankrupt is necessary. The thrust of his submissions was that there is no need for a potential surplus in the bankruptcy, that other substantial interests were sufficient, and that the Brakes had such an interest as a result of Mr Swift’s allegedly unconscionable and wrongful conduct. In particular, he pointed out that it was pleaded that Mr Swift’s conduct was beyond his powers as a trustee in bankruptcy, that he had colluded with Chedington and Dr Guy and accordingly, to the extent that his powers had been exercised there was a fraud on a power, and that the Brakes had a direct interest, in particular, in the creation of the Licence.    </p>

The debtor was adjudicated bankrupt in 1940 and was discharged in 1943. He owned a large number of small houses. Much of the property consisted of short term leaseholds and much of it was mortgaged. It was impossible to realise it at a reasonable figure and so the trustee carried on the management of the business for some years. In 1948 he proposed to sell the remaining properties and pay the creditors in full. At that stage, the bankrupt issued a motion complaining about the trustee in bankruptcy’s administration of the estate. The question was whether the former bankrupt was a “person aggrieved” in the relevant section. There was no allegation of fraud or dishonesty. Having explained the nature of the bankruptcy regime, Harman J stated at 240 – 241, as follows: </p>

The point, of course, can only arise where the bankrupt can show that there is, or will, or might (but for the trustee’s action or inaction), be a surplus in the trustee’s hands after satisfying in full all the claims of the creditors. Where, as in the vast majority of cases, the estate is insolvent, the bankrupt has clearly no interest in it and it matters not to him how it is administered, but the bankrupt has a statutory right to any surplus under s. 69 of the Act, and is, therefore, clearly concerned to increase, if he can, its amount.  </p>

The joint liquidators caused the company to institute proceedings for negligence in relation to the audit of the company’s financial statements. The plaintiff, which was not a creditor or contributory of the company but one of the defendants to the company’s action, applied under section 106(1) Companies Law (1995 rev) for an order removing the liquidators, or alternatively restraining them from continuing the proceedings against them on the grounds that the liquidators had a conflict of interest. The statute did not contain any reference to the category of persons who were eligible to apply.

In the context of an application for annulment under s 282(1)(b) the amount of the trustee’s remuneration and expenses may be a matter of considerable significance, because it affects the amount of money required to be paid in order to satisfy the court of the matters referred to in the subsection. In my view the bankrupt had a clear interest in this, for he will want the annulment to be obtained as cheaply as possible. This will clearly be the case where the bankrupt is persuading a third party to lend him the money or intends to enter into an obligation to indemnify a third party who puts up the necessary funds. I consider that it will also be so even where there is to be no formal obligation as between the bankrupt and the third party. The prospects of the third party making funds available are likely to be increased if the amount required is kept to a minimum. Further the bankrupt is likely to feel under a moral obligation to indemnify the third party even where he is under no legal obligation.” </p>

This is consistent with the approach in all of the cases to which I have referred and has been the case for a considerable time and was articulated in the <span style="font-style:italic">Dodwell</span> case in 1949. The very nature of the bankruptcy regime is such that the bankrupt having taken the benefit of being relieved of his debts, absent fraud, cannot have the standing to interfere with the day-to-day administration of the estate by the trustee on behalf of the creditors. He must be able to show that he has a substantial interest which has been affected by the conduct complained of and a direct interest in the relief sought. The potential existence of a surplus is one way of being able to demonstrate such a substantial interest but it seems to me that it is not the only one.  </p>

In fact, Mr Davies accepted that they had not pleaded fraud but only fraud on a power in the equitable sense. As my Lord, Henderson LJ, pointed out during the hearing, that is not the same thing. The judge cannot be criticised, therefore, for having failed to take fraud into account.  </p>

It will be apparent from everything which I have already said in relation to the Bankruptcy Application under section 303(1) that I do not consider that the Brakes in their capacity as trustees of the Settlement have standing to bring the Liquidation Application. All of the matters which were relevant in relation to their application under section 303(1) apply equally here. As Nourse LJ stated in the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote</span> case, in their capacity as bidders, the Brakes were outsiders to the liquidation. The Brakes as trustees were not contributories to the liquidation, no debt was owed to them in the liquidation and there was no evidence that they had any other interest in it. As the judge noted, it was a mere chance that they were trustees of the Settlement at all and in that capacity, they did not have a substantial interest in the relief sought in order to render them “aggrieved” for the purposes of section 168(5). Further, the court’s inherent power to supervise the conduct of its officers cannot assist a mere bidder to establish standing for the purposes of section 168(5) any more than it can under section 303(1).  </p>

First, the judge having held that the Unsecured Creditors were advancing the Brakes’ case and that the Brakes lacked standing to bring the Liquidation Application, and, accordingly, that the Unsecured Creditors did not have a legitimate interest in the relief sought, if the Brakes as trustees of the Settlement were held on appeal to have standing, the ruling in relation to the Unsecured Creditors should be reversed.  </p>

He gave no, or alternatively, insufficient weight to the fact that they are undisputed, bona fide creditors in the liquidation. He ought to have held that the relief sought was in the interests of the unsecured creditors and not adverse to it and that they had standing for the purposes of section 168(5).  </p>

Miss Lintner on behalf of the Unsecured Creditors submits, in effect, that the judge allowed his reasoning to become clouded by the fact that he found on the basis of unchallenged evidence that the Unsecured Creditors were being funded by the Brakes and were advancing their case, and failed to take separate account of their capacity as unsecured creditors in the liquidation. She relies upon the dicta in the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote</span> case at 393f where Nourse LJ stated that even if the applicants in that case were strangers to the liquidation in their capacity as persons who had not been given an opportunity to bid for an asset, they still would have been able to apply in their dual capacity as creditors.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Miss Lintner’s new argument, advanced in her supplemental skeleton argument and in her oral submissions, is that just as in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fakhry</span> case, the Unsecured Creditors have standing because they are included within the terms of section 168(5) itself. Although not expressly identified in the statute (unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">Fakhry</span> where members are expressly mentioned in section 1029(1) Companies Act 2006), Miss Lintner draws attention to the fact that it is accepted that “any person aggrieved” in section 168(5) is shorthand for “any creditor, debtor or other person aggrieved”. See the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote</span> case per Nourse LJ at 393h-i. She says, therefore, that the Unsecured Creditors have standing in that capacity alone and without more. </p>

She says, therefore, that the interests of the Unsecured Creditors are not adverse to creditors in the liquidation as they were in <span style="font-style:italic">Walker Morris v</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Khalastchi</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Fairfield</span>.  </p>

She says that this has nothing to do with standing and if it is relevant at all would be considered at a substantive hearing. She relies upon [57] of the judgment of David Richards LJ in this regard. Having held at [44] and [46] that a former member had standing for the purposes of an application to restore the company to the register pursuant to section 1029 Companies Act 2006, David Richards LJ went on to consider whether the purpose of the application affected the applicant’s standing in the following terms:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, I agree with Mr Sutcliffe that Miss Lintner’s argument that standing as unsecured creditors is enough without more, is not open to her given the grounds on which permission to appeal was granted to the Unsecured Creditors. Even if it were, it is quite clear that it is necessary that an applicant is “aggrieved” for the purposes of section 168(5). See the <span style="font-style:italic">Edennote </span>case at 393 e-f.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In any event, Miss Lintner appeared to accept impliedly that more was needed by her submissions in relation to the potential difference to the estate if the acceptance of the Chedington bid were reversed. It seems to me that David Richards LJ’s approach to standing for the purposes of section 1029 Companies Act 2006 is of no more assistance to the Unsecured Creditors than it was to the Brakes in the Bankruptcy Appeal. As I have already mentioned, the circumstances with which section 1029 is concerned are entirely different from those to which section 168(5) applies and it is inevitable that in addition to being expressly named in the provision, a former member will have a real and direct interest in the question of whether a company should be restored to the register. Accordingly, that case is of no real assistance to the Unsecured Creditors here.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Do the Unsecured Creditors, nevertheless, have a legitimate interest in the relief sought in the Liquidation Application? It seems to me that that is very doubtful. The relief sought is that, amongst other things, the joint liquidators accept the Brakes’ bid for the Cottage in the sum of £476,000, made in their capacity as trustees of the Settlement. That must be adverse to the interests of the liquidation estate and the unsecured creditors as a whole in just the same way as the position of the creditors in the <span style="font-style:italic">Walker Morris</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Fairfield</span> cases. Furthermore, Mr Sutcliffe says that even if the Brakes were given an opportunity to bid £570,000 for the Cottage (which is pleaded), it is common ground that the £70,000 in excess of the Chedington bid would be soaked up by expenses.  </p>

That case was concerned with an application by the former solicitors of a company in liquidation (who were still acting for its holding company and two of its former directors). The applicants sought directions from the court as to whether they needed to provide purportedly privileged documents regarding the company’s tax affairs to the liquidator, and (if they did) sought a direction that the liquidator could not disclose those documents to the Inland Revenue which considered it had a claim for unpaid tax against the company without a court order.  </p>

Instead, he found the applicants’ only real concern was to frustrate the Inland Revenue’s claim for the benefit of their existing clients, rather than to advance any legitimate interest as creditors. See 7F-G. In fact, creditors of the company stood to gain from the Inland Revenue’s claim, which could result in a dividend being returned to the company and distributed to its creditors.
