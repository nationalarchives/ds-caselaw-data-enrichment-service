The respondent (“Mr Barton”) owns the long lease of an apartment in a building known as Victoria Mill in Reddish, Stockport.  He made a section 116 request to the appellant (“Houldsworth”), which is the management company of Victoria Mill.  In his request he stated that the reason that he wished to inspect the register of members was to seek a general meeting of members of Houldsworth with a </p>

Instead, the judge directed Houldsworth, pursuant to section 117(5) of the Act, immediately to comply with the request.  He did, however, grant a stay of execution so as to allow Houldsworth to make an application for permission to appeal to this court.  Permission to appeal was granted by Newey LJ on 17 February 2020.  </p>

In his first witness statement Mr Macdonald explained that Houldsworth’s responsibilities to manage the building arose under the terms of the lease.  He recognised that Houldsworth was also a company limited by guarantee, that its affairs as a corporate entity were separately governed by its articles of association and by company legislation, and that the occupational leaseholders (including Mr Barton) were members of the company.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Macdonald went on to say that he did not consider Mr Barton’s purpose to be a proper purpose because his concerns were centred on matters relating to Houldsworth and its roles and responsibilities under the tripartite leases, “<span style="font-style:italic">rather than</span> … <span style="font-style:italic">the conduct of corporate affairs</span>”.  He explained that Living City was engaged as managing agent for Victoria Mill to undertake the day-to-day performance on behalf of Houldsworth “<span style="font-style:italic">in relation to the management functions [Houldsworth] holds regarding Victoria Mill</span>”.  He expressed the view that Mr Barton’s actions were motivated “<span style="font-style:italic">by the desire to interfere with matters relating to the management of the building, as opposed to company matters (to which section 116 relates)”</span>. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Macdonald expanded on these views in his second witness statement, where he expressed the view that Mr Barton’s purpose was not a proper one, for two separate reasons.  The first, narrow reason was that, according to Mr Macdonald, Mr Barton’s stated purpose of calling a general meeting to remove the directors and the managing agent was, in itself, improper because there were other, more appropriate methods to achieve this result.  In support of this ground he asserted that the appointment of managing agents <span style="font-style:italic">“is not a decision for members to make” </span>and that<span style="font-style:italic"> “therefore provision of the register of members would do nothing to aid [Mr Barton’s] desires in that regard.”</span>  He continued that “<span style="font-style:italic">The true purpose behind [Mr Barton’s] request is to exercise greater control over [Houldsworth’s] management responsibilities at Victoria Mill, which arises under the terms of the occupational leases and is not linked to [Houldsworth’s] corporate affairs</span>.”  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second, broader reason advanced by Mr Macdonald was that Mr Barton’s “real motive” was to remove the current directors in order to further his own interests and cause disruption at Victoria Mill.  He said that this was supported by what he described as a “<span style="font-style:italic">long history of non-payment of service charges, unjustified litigation with no merit and a strong desire to take over the management functions at various developments in which he owns leasehold properties</span>.”   His second witness statement went on to recount details of previous litigation between Mr Barton and Houldsworth, and to refer to a previous case involving the management company of a different building, Pandongate House, which had resulted in a direction under section 117(3) of </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Houldsworth’s application under section 117 was also supported by a witness statement from Mr Damiano Rea, a director of the managing agent appointed by the management company of Pandongate House, recounting the history of the engagement between the Pandongate House management company and Mr Barton.  As reliance is placed by Houldsworth on the decision of HHJ Kramer in that case, it will be necessary to return to it later in this judgment. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Fox-Davies</span> at [49] David Richards LJ said that section 116 applies the same purpose test to all requests, whether they are made by members of the company or not.  That would not be a correct statement if there was some special requirement for members.

This gave rise to an argument that the request was not a proper notice under section 116.  HHJ Kramer resolved this issue in favour of Mr Barton, and then went on to consider two further contentions, which have parallels in the contentions of Houldsworth in the present case. The first, narrow contention was whether the purpose was not a proper one because it did not relate to Mr Barton’s interests as a member of the company, or the exercise of shareholders’ rights, or the interests of the other members as members. The second, broader contention was that the true purpose was to disrupt the proper working of the company and to harass its members.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">HHJ Kramer then went on to consider, specifically, whether contacting leaseholders for the purpose of supporting challenges to the service charges and retention of the managing agents was a proper purpose. He considered it important to distinguish between Mr Barton’s rights in his capacity as a member of a company and his rights in his capacity as a leaseholder.  The former arose under the articles of association of the company, whereas the latter arose under the lease.  He accepted a submission on behalf of the management company (see paragraph 47) that a request which seeks to gain names and addresses to contact leaseholders in order to consult or persuade them to use the rights they have in that capacity was “<span style="font-style:italic">entirely distinct from a request to contact them about matters relating to the company, their shareholding or the related exercise of their rights</span>.”  He gave an example of a retailing company where a member sought to inspect the list of members in order to communicate to them their dissatisfaction with a shirt purchased from the retailer which had shrunk in the wash. These considerations satisfied HHJ Kramer that the request in that case was not for a proper purpose, “<span style="font-style:italic">because it was nothing to do with the interests of a member as member</span>”.    He considered (see paragraph 48) that that conclusion “<span style="font-style:italic">struck a proper balance between the conflicting considerations of shareholder democracy and public interest in knowing the identity of the owners of a company</span>”. </p>

That basis was his conclusion that the purpose for which Mr Barton was seeking the list was to further his interests as a leaseholder in the block of flats of which the Respondent is the management company and had nothing to do with his interests as a member of that company. If that had been the sole basis for the Judge's decision, I might have considered that the challenge had a real prospect of success.  However, he also decided the application on a second basis; that Mr Barton's wish to obtain the information was in order to harass the company or harm its members.  That conclusion was based on his findings arising from detailed evidence put in by the Respondent as to Mr Barton's previous behaviour, both in relation to the block of flats at Pandongate House and other properties.  I consider that ground 4 of the Appellant's grounds of appeal against that decision has no prospect of success and, therefore, the appeal as a whole, even if Mr Barton were to succeed on his first three grounds, would not result in a different order.” </p>

At [25] of his judgment the judge said that he found HHJ Kramer’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Pandongate</span> to be “of little assistance to the court in the present case”.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It was common ground before the judge that an intention to call a meeting to remove directors was not, in itself, an improper purpose.  It was, however, contended that an intention to remove the managing agents was improper.  It was submitted that this distinction was justified because, as cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Morshead Mansions Ltd v Di Marco</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 1371; [2009] H.L.R. 33 showed, there was a fundamental distinction between the rights of a member as member of a company and the rights of a leaseholder against the landlord. The judge rejected this contention.  At [42] to [43] the judge concluded that Mr Barton’s stated purpose was, in the light of Houldsworth’s objects set out in its memorandum of association, an entirely proper one.   </p>

To the extent that Mr Barton’s past conduct might give rise to any cause for concern, this could be dealt with by means of an undertaking to use the information solely for the stated purpose.  The judge therefore dismissed Houldsworth’s application. </p>

He submitted, however, that the judge had been wrong to reject the narrow basis and hold that Mr Barton’s stated purpose was a proper one for the purposes of section 117 of the Act.  It was essential to differentiate between the two different capacities of Mr Barton.  These were his capacity as a party to the long-term lease which provides for a range of services to be provided by Houldsworth, and his capacity as a member of Houldsworth as a company.  The appointment and removal of managing agents was relevant to the first capacity but not the second.  The judge had fallen into error by equating the management and governance of the company with the discharge of covenants for services under the lease.  Section 116 was only concerned with matters relating to corporate governance. </p>

In that case, the management company of a block of flats had obtained approval at a general meeting to require shareholder contributions in order to set up a “recovery fund” for fees, costs and other expenses incurred in the implementation of the company’s objects.  The defendant declined to make his contribution to the fund, contending that the sums were service charges under section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, and that the company was not entitled to decide summarily to collect service charges which could be recovered, if reasonable, under the terms of the lease.  Mummery LJ (with whom Ward and Toulson LJJ agreed) said this at [30][31]: </p>

In my judgment, Mr Di Marco’s contentions, which were forcefully made, pay insufficient regard to the crucial legal distinction between the liability of a tenant to the landlord under a lease containing service charge provisions, and the liability of the member of a company, in which all the tenants are shareholders, to the company under separate contracts made in and pursuant to the Articles to establish and recover contributions to a Recovery Fund. The two kinds of legal relationship can co-exist between the same parties, but they are different relationships incurred in different capacities and they give rise to different enforceable legal obligations. A defence to one of the claims is not necessarily available as a defence to the other legally separate claim.  </p>

The judge did not decide and was not asked to decide whether section 18 applied to Mr Di Marco as a tenant. He was not deciding whether Morshead could avoid altogether the statutory protection which Mr Di Marco might enjoy as tenant if he were sued under the provisions of the lease or if he invoked the terms of the lease and the statutory provisions in his capacity as tenant.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">First, it is clear that it is impossible in the present case to draw a sharp dividing line between the covenants under the lease and the affairs of the company.  Houldsworth’s sole relevant purpose under its constitution was the management of Victoria Mill.  So, a complaint which relates to the appointment of agents to carry out the day-to-day management of Victoria Mill is central to the objects of the company and to the way in which the company is run.  Such a complaint, as it seems to me, is a matter concerning the affairs of the company which it is legitimate to seek to raise at a general meeting. It therefore lies within the area of overlap between the two sets of rights, those of shareholder and those of leaseholder.  The example of an individual complaint about inadequate painting and HHJ Kramer’s example in <span style="font-style:italic">Pandongate</span> of a shirt bought from a retailer which shrank in the wash seem to me to be inapt because they do not necessarily reflect on the way in which the company is being run by the directors.    </p>

He accepted that it could.  In those circumstances, it seems to me to be difficult if not impossible to suggest that Mr Barton has an improper purpose in seeking to obtain support for such a meeting at which such a resolution could be passed, whatever his rights may be under the terms of his lease or under the landlord and tenant legislation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, I do not think that corporate governance, at least in this context, has the narrow meaning for which Mr Bates contended.  When Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Burry </span>referred to the importance of section 116 for ensuring proper corporate governance, I do not think that she had in mind such a narrow concept.  In my judgment, so much is clear from her inclusion within the notion of corporate governance of “<span style="font-style:italic">the shareholders monitoring the activities of the directors</span>”, and her unqualified acceptance that the desire to obtain support for the requisitioning of a general meeting was a proper purpose.  Similarly, I doubt that David Richards LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Fox-Davies </span>would have said that it would require unusual facts to prevent inspection by a member seeking to requisition a meeting if there was a restriction of the kind contended for, namely that the general meeting must not be one which is to consider matters which relate to the business undertaken by the company.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">I think that Judge Kramer fell into error in this part of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Pandongate</span>.  He appears to have treated Arden LJ’s observation in <span style="font-style:italic">Burry</span> as a rigid requirement, such that a request which is not made by “a member as member” is necessarily not made for a proper purpose.  I have already explained why I consider that that is not a proper reading of Arden LJ’s judgment, not least because it applies, inconsistently with <span style="font-style:italic">Fox-Davies,</span> a different test to members and non-members.  In reasoning in the manner in which he did I think that Judge Kramer lost sight of the requirement to ask whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the individual case, the request is a proper one.  That requires a focus on the facts and circumstances of the case, and cannot be answered simply by reference to the capacity in which the request is made.  Nevertheless, as Rose LJ has already pointed out when refusing permission to appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Pandongate</span>, that error would not have affected the outcome in that case. </p>

It is not for Houldsworth to determine in which capacity Mr Barton may choose to challenge the appointment of the managing agents.   The fact that Houldsworth may regard the appointment of managing agents as falling within their duties under the lease does not assist. </p>
