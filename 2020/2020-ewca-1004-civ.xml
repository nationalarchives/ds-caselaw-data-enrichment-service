	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.00in">This claim is starkly in contrast with the Hillingdon case. In the Hillingdon proceedings, the challenge was to a specific decision within the approval process, though not to the principle of the project itself being permitted to proceed, and its success would not prevent the project progressing in accordance with the programme set for it. Here, however, the challenge is to the Government’s decision to proceed with the HS2 project itself, for part of which Parliamentary approval has long since been given. It does not touch any of the statutory processes by which that part of the project has been approved in principle, or any present or future decision-making under the statutory regime in place for subsequent approvals. It is directed to the Government’s commitment to the implementation of HS2. But neither case involves us, the court, in the political controversy and debate surrounding HS2. To echo what a different constitution of the Court of Appeal said in its judgment on the recent appeal in the Heathrow third runway case – <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of Plan B Earth) v Secretary of State for Transport </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 214 (at paragraphs 2 and 281 to 285) – our task in adjudicating on these claims for judicial review has nothing at all to do with the merits of HS2 as a project. That is the Government’s responsibility, not the court’s. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.87in;margin-right:0.00in">The claim came before the Divisional Court (Coulson L.J. and Holgate J.) on 3 April 2020. At the end of the hearing, the court announced its decision to refuse permission to apply for judicial review and the application for an interim injunction. In a substantial judgment handed down on 6 April 2020, it gave its reasons for those decisions. In doing so, it emphasised – as we must too – that it was “only concerned with whether the decision being challenged is unlawful in some way”, and that although “members of the public have strongly held views for and against the HS2 project, … it is not part of the court’s role to deal with its pros and cons” (paragraph 5 of the judgment). It concluded that the claim had not been brought promptly, in accordance with CPR r.54.5(1), and fell to be dismissed for that reason in any event (paragraph 126). It described the Oakervee review, and the Government’s decision based upon it, as “limited in scope and macro-political in nature”. It held that the only realistic basis on which the decision could be challenged was on “conventional, ‘light touch’ <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> grounds” (paragraph 127). And it rejected all four grounds of the claim as unarguable (paragraphs 128 to 131). </p>

He acknowledged that such a hearing in this court is unusual. But three things made it appropriate here: first, the Divisional Court had given “comprehensive reasons” for refusing permission to apply for judicial review, and if permission were now granted, the claim would likely be retained in this court; second, the timetable was “tight”, because further clearance work had been arranged; and third, there was “considerable public interest in the case”.  </p>

Among the issues raised in the consultation was the need – both on transport planning and on socio-economic grounds – for a major increase in rail capacity and a significant improvement in connections between cities to deal with the predicted growth in passenger numbers, and to enhance the performance of the West Coast Main Line and other parts of the existing rail network. In January 2012, the Government published its adopted high-speed rail strategy and the route for Phase One.

The long title of the 2017 Act is “An Act to make provision for a railway between Euston in London and a junction with the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre in Staffordshire, with a spur from Water Orton in Warwickshire to Curzon Street in Birmingham; and for connected purposes”. Section 1 gives power to HS2 Ltd. as nominated undertaker to construct and maintain the works specified in Schedule 1 to the Act – the “scheduled works” – being works for the construction of Phase One and works consequent on, or incidental to, such works. Section 20 grants deemed planning permission under Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for the carrying out of development authorised by the 2017 Act. Development consisting of the carrying out of a work that is not a scheduled work falls within the scope of the deemed planning permission if it is covered by an “environmental assessment” in connection with the Phase One Bill (section 20(2)(c)). </p>

This is driven by the construction of tunnels, earthworks, bridges, viaducts and underpasses.

Research by Eurostar has shown for example that a Eurostar journey from London to Paris emits 90% less greenhouse gas emissions per passenger than the equivalent short haul flight. Nevertheless, the Review notes that the whole rail network needs to be decarbonised if the government is to deliver its net zero target.

As Keene L.J. said (at paragraph 24), it “emphasises the need for swiftness of action”. That approach was supported by Sales L.J. in<span style="font-style:italic"> Gerber</span> (at paragraphs 11 and 49). The Divisional Court also referred to the six-week time limit for challenges to development consent orders for nationally significant infrastructure projects under section 118 of the Planning Act 2008, and claims for judicial review brought under the “planning acts” (see CPR r.54.5(5)). It thought the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Finn-Kelcey</span> was “relevant to the analogous circumstances of the present case”.

It was made outside the six-week period “for planning cases generally”. The announcement made on 11 February 2020 could not have come as a surprise to anybody. Lord Berkeley had made clear his dissatisfaction with the process in a letter to the Secretary of State dated 11 November 2019, and had repeated his concerns in his dissenting report of 5 January 2020. There was nothing in grounds 2 and 3 that arose from information provided after 11 February 2020. And the delay in bringing the claim would also result in the clearance works being put back by another five or six months. The delay was not justified by unanswered requests by Mr Packham’s solicitors for documents considered when the decision was made. The proceedings had been begun without that information. The court therefore concluded that the challenge had not been made promptly, and that the application for permission should be dismissed for this reason alone (paragraphs 39 to 45). </p>

It had been difficult to establish what works HS2 Ltd. was actually carrying out, and Mr Packham’s solicitors were awaiting a response to their request for further information.

In our view, for three reasons, the claim was made promptly for the purposes of CPR r.54.5(1)(a). First, this was a claim for judicial review outside the procedure specifically introduced for claims brought under the </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.90in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“planning acts”, in CPR r.54.5(5). The relevant time limit was therefore not six weeks but three months “after the grounds to make the claim first arose”. The claim was issued well within that period, more than five weeks before it expired. Secondly, it is, we think, inappropriate to treat this case as analogous with challenges falling within the scope of the six-week time limit under section 118 of the Planning Act and CPR r.54.5(5) on the basis that the subject matter of the challenge was a decision that followed a process in which a series of planning decisions had been made under the legislative scheme for the approvals required by the HS2 project. The decision with which we are concerned lies wholly outside that legislative scheme. Indeed, as the Divisional Court itself rightly emphasised (in paragraphs 46 to 57 of its judgment), neither the Oakervee review nor the Government’s decision of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>February 2020 were made within any statutory framework, whether for the planning of major infrastructure or otherwise. This was a process undertaken entirely under common law powers. And thirdly, we would give no significant weight to the fact that some information relevant to the challenge, such as Lord Berkley’s dissenting report, was available before the decision was taken. Indeed, if anything, the occurrence of that dissent might be seen as a factor that made the Government’s decision harder to foresee. But in any event the claim – whether sound or not – rests on the content of the review report, which was not published in its final form until 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>February 2020, when the decision was announced.

The intensity of the review and the breadth of the margin of discretion accorded are conceptually different.

The reasons for this can be stated shortly. First, the decision to proceed with HS2 was taken at the very highest level of Government. It was largely a matter of political judgment. Secondly, at the date of the decision the Cabinet can be taken to have been aware, at least, of the existence of the 2017 Act and the fact that in the course of the passage of the Phase One Bill through Parliament a detailed assessment of environmental impacts had already been carried out. That assessment had not precluded the coming into force of the statute. It remained lawful and valid at the time of the Oakervee review, and at the time of the decision. So did the statutory approval process itself. And that will remain so regardless of the outcome of these proceedings. Thirdly, it is not said that, in the period between Royal Assent and the Cabinet’s decision, there had been any physical change in circumstances bearing on the assessment of environmental effects that was either capable of undermining the assessment or of affecting the operation of the 2017 Act. Fourthly, in arriving at the decision, the Cabinet had to balance a number of significant – and potentially conflicting – political, economic, social and environmental considerations. Fifthly, largely for that reason, there was not a single “right” decision. A decision either way might be perfectly reasonable. And sixthly, the review report had obvious limitations, </p>

An environmental impact assessment of that phase had been undertaken, in accordance with EU and domestic legislation, including public consultation, during the process of Parliamentary scrutiny. Petitions against the Bill had been brought by local authorities and by national and local wildlife and woodland trusts, and had been heard by Select Committees appointed by each House. The works were subject to regulation by Natural England as competent authority through the operation of the licensing procedures in Parts 3 to 5 of the Habitats Regulations. And they had to be carried out in accordance with the published HS2 Phase One Code of Construction Practice. </p>

The Divisional Court observed, however, that “the extent of a Minister’s actual knowledge is not in itself a public law ground for vitiating his decision”, and that “[the] real question is what as a matter of law <span style="font-style:italic">ought</span> the Minister to have known about when taking his decision” (see the judgment of Sedley L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">National Association of Health Stores</span>, at paragraphs 39 to 65) (paragraph 50).

The review could not be divorced from that process, as the review report had itself made clear (paragraph 56).

No legal reason had been advanced to explain why that kind of assessment would need to be repeated (paragraph 82). Environmental impact assessments for Phase 2a and Phase 2b would also be carried out in the Parliamentary proceedings. There was no indication in the terms of reference that the review should carry out that type of assessment itself (paragraph 83). They did not mention environmental impacts, apart from climate change. It was “a matter of judgment for the review process … what matters would be covered in the Report”, and that exercise of judgment could only be challenged by judicial review if it was “irrational or <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonable”. The same test applied to the decision itself (paragraph 85). Mr. Wolfe had not suggested that the panel received any representations on the environmental impacts of Phase One that had not already been addressed in the proceedings on the Bill (paragraph 86). The review report referred to the impacts on ancient woodland, landscape, biodiversity and the built and natural environment, and recognised that such impacts were to some extent unavoidable for a project such as HS2. It stressed the importance of the appropriate mitigation and compensatory measures being carried out, and kept under review (paragraph 87).  </p>

Mr Packham’s case on this ground is not a complaint about what the Oakervee review was required to assess, or what the review should have done – but about what it said it had done. It is, essentially, that the Secretary of State was told, and would therefore have assumed when the decision to proceed with the project was made, that the review report had set out a “full and proper” account of HS2’s harmful environmental impacts, whereas it had not done so at all. This misunderstanding of the scope of the report must have affected the weight the Government gave to the report’s conclusions and recommendation, including the economic assessment, which showed a much weaker benefit-cost ratio than in 2017. That the Divisional Court had fallen into this error was apparent both from its summary of Mr Packham’s case (in paragraphs 77 and 78 of the judgment) and from its conclusions (in paragraphs 80 to 88).  </p>

When the Government made its decision to proceed with the project in February 2020, the factual context in which the Oakervee review had come to be set up in August 2019 was a matter of record. Phase One of the project had passed through a lengthy process of consultation, assessment – including environmental impact assessment – and statutory approval. The process had been punctuated by challenges in the courts, and its lawfulness had been confirmed. Statutory authorisation for Phase One was embodied in the 2017 Act, which referred in several of its provisions to the environmental impact assessment that had been carried out. The Parliamentary process was well advanced for Phase 2a, and would soon begin for Phase 2b. </p>

HS2 Ltd., as nominated undertaker, was under a contractual duty to comply with the EMRs and to ensure that both the construction and operation of Phase One were controlled in accordance with that assessment. It was an appropriately extensive and thorough assessment. Matters raised in representations in the course of the Oakervee review, and to which Mr Packham refers in these proceedings – such as the effects of tunnel boring on water quality and water supply and the possible dewatering of the River Misbourne and Shardeloes Lake, and ecological effects of various kinds – had already been raised in petitions against the Bill. Such effects were addressed in the environmental statement and controlled under the EMRs. These are merely a few examples.

Those cases are all significantly distinguishable from this. As Mr Mould said, they all relate to the performance of a particular statutory duty or statutory procedure, or the fulfilment of common law rules. Here, however, the situation is quite different. As the Divisional Court recognised, this case does not involve an alleged failure on the part of the decision-maker to perform some statutory duty or procedure, or to fulfil any common law rule. The starting point for the whole exercise entailed in the Oakervee review, and the Government’s subsequent decision, was that the project had the requisite statutory approval to enable it to proceed, and that statutory approval had emerged from a process in which, among other things, environmental impact assessment and public consultation had been carried out. The decision now being taken was not a decision on the planning merits; it was a decision on whether or not to proceed with a project whose planning merits had already been considered in a statutory process, and its first phase approved in an Act of Parliament (see paragraphs 13 to 19 above).

To do so was not necessary to discharge any duty arising under any Act of Parliament or at common law, or to comply with any policy promulgated by this or any previous administration.

That is not surprising. To have asked the panel to venture upon so challenging and time-consuming an exercise would have been wholly unnecessary. It had already been done, comprehensively, and lawfully, for Phase One of the project. The results of it were recorded, and had been published, in the environmental statement and supplementary environmental statements produced in the course of the statutory procedures through which Phase One had been taken between 2013 and 2017, culminating in the works being authorised in the 2017 Act. The environmental impact assessment had informed the design and the requisite mitigation and compensation measures for that phase, which were now established.

The report does not say, or imply, any such thing. It does not replicate, amend or replace the assessment in the environmental statement and supplementary environmental statements already completed and in the public domain, of which minsters would have been well aware. It does not criticise or question any of that assessment. No one could sensibly take it as presenting a “full and proper” account of the harmful environmental impacts of the HS2 project as a whole. For the panel to have attempted an alternative environmental impact assessment of its own would have been to exceed its brief by a long way. And it did not.

There, the Secretary of State accepted he had not had regard to the Paris Agreement at all, because it was not considered at that stage to be relevant.

Instead, the Report considered the effects of the project before and after 2050 resulting from construction and the first 60 years of operation. The conclusion that the project is “likely to be close to carbon neutral” relates to that overall period, both before and after 2050. The OR considered that HS2 could be less carbon intensive than alternative forms of transport used to manage increased demand for travel (5.32) and also that it would produce carbon savings during the operational phase. It is obvious from the Report that the construction phase, which predates 2050, would increase carbon emissions during that period and that that effect is only off-set by carbon savings resulting from the operation of the scheme over a long period of time.

The United Kingdom was already struggling to meet those budgets. In the Committee on Climate Change’s report “Net Zero: The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming”, published in May 2019, it was noted that the fourth and fifth carbon budgets “were set on the path to the existing 80% target and therefore are likely to be too loose”. The critical point, submitted Mr Wolfe, was that the Government ought to have considered the “legal implications” of the emissions generated in constructing HS2, and not solely their “factual existence”. The Paris Agreement was “obviously material” to this decision in the same way as it had been to the designation of the ANPS in <span style="font-style:italic">Plan B Earth</span>. Yet the Government had not considered the obligations established by the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act, and how the construction of HS2 would undermine them. To suggest that the implications of constructing HS2 for the Government’s commitment to the reduction of carbon emissions in the period before 2050 were obvious to the Oakervee review panel, or to the Government itself, was, Mr Wolfe submitted, incorrect. The review report noted that increases in emissions would occur in the construction period, but was silent on their legal consequences. In particular, it did not explain, nor did the Government take into account, how the impacts of HS2 on climate change would sit with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, and the domestic legal framework designed to carry it into effect.

First, the Oakervee review was not an exercise compelled, or even provided for, in any legislation relating to climate change, in any legislation relating to major infrastructure, or in any legislation at all. It finds no place in </p>

Nor does it belong to any other statutory scheme, such as the Planning Act, in which the consequences of major infrastructure development for climate change are explicitly provided for as a necessary feature of decision-making. The same goes for the Government’s own decision on the future of HS2.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.97in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, as with the previous issue, we must pay attention to the review’s terms of reference, which, as we have said, were not the product of any statutory duty or other legal requirement, but were drafted autonomously by the Government to indicate the matters on which it required advice in making its decision. We need not repeat what we have already said about that. But it is worth recalling here that in the terms of reference the only mention of any consideration relating to climate change is in connection with “environmental benefits” – namely, “in particular for carbon reduction in line with net zero commitments”. This is not a shortcoming in the terms of reference, but merely a fact. The Government was under no obligation, statutory or otherwise, to extend them by requiring a wider or deeper consideration of the consequences for climate change of constructing and operating HS2, or by embracing, for example, the “legal implications” of increases in carbon emissions caused by the construction of the project.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.97in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to the content of the review report, we see no basis for the criticism levelled at it by Mr Wolfe. It is clear – and Mr Wolfe does not dispute this – that the panel was well aware of the Government’s determination to adhere, and give effect, to provisions of the Paris Agreement, which had by then been translated into domestic legislation in the corresponding provisions of the Climate Change Act. The panel was also familiar with what this meant in practice, in the form of commitments with statutory backing behind them. It referred in paragraph 5.30 of the report to the Government having “committed to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050”. That is clearly a reference to the Government’s commitment to the main aspiration of the Paris Agreement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.97in;margin-right:0.00in">In the following paragraphs the panel did not neglect the period before 2050. On the contrary, it took care to consider what would be happening in the course of that period. It concentrated on emissions likely to be generated in the construction of HS2, which would be going on during those years. It acknowledged that construction would inevitably produce high levels of carbon emissions, estimated at “around 0.1% of current UK emissions on an annual basis” (paragraph 5.31). It set that conclusion against the “carbon impacts” likely to result from the construction and operation of “alternative transport schemes” with “similar transport outcomes” (paragraph 5.32). It referred to the “longer term” potential of HS2 to promote “modal shift”, but pointed out that “the whole rail network needs to be decarbonised if the government is to deliver its net zero target”. It suggested that “HS2 should be considered carefully in the role it could play in helping meet this target” (paragraph 5.33). The conclusion was one of balance, “taking into account both the construction and operation of HS2” – that “HS2 is likely to be carbon neutral …”, and it was therefore “important for HS2 Ltd to continue to look for ways to be more carbon efficient, particularly in construction in the short-medium term” (paragraph 5.37). That analysis informed the advice in Conclusion 5. Here too the panel was clearly thinking about the achievement of the Government’s “2050 target”, and how the “construction and delivery” of HS2, both in Phase One and in Phase Two, could be managed “to reduce … forecast greenhouse gas emissions”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.97in;margin-right:0.00in">There are three difficulties for Mr Wolfe’s reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Plan B Earth</span> in this case, and they are, we believe, fatal. First, as will be clear from what we have said of the grounds on which this court granted relief in <span style="font-style:italic">Plan B Earth</span>, that case was markedly different from this. In this case the decision under challenge was not taken under a statutory scheme in which the decision-making process is shaped as it is under the provisions of the Planning Act governing the designation of a national policy statement, with specific duties such as those in sections 5(8) and 10(3) – or under any statutory scheme. To make the decision at all was itself a matter of free choice for the Government, as were the decision-making parameters themselves. The Government was at liberty to select the issues on which it wished to be advised by the Oakervee review, against the background of HS2’s evolution as a project, including the statutory approval process. In doing so it was not constrained by the provisions of the Climate Change Act or by any policy of its own. Secondly, the advice the Government received in the review report dealt amply with the implications of, and for, the United Kingdom’s commitments on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change following the Paris Agreement. In the context in which that advice was given, it was legally impeccable. And thirdly, as Mr Mould submitted, when in February 2020 the Government made its decision to proceed with HS2 it can be taken to have been fully aware of the United Kingdom’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, and its own responsibilities under the Climate Change Act, and to have taken those commitments and responsibilities into account.
