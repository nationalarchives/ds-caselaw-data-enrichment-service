On 24 July 2015 Mr Taylor agreed to lend the sum of US$1,591,040 for a period of six months pursuant to written Heads of Terms (“the Heads of Terms”) which named the borrower as Van Dutch Marine Holdings Ltd (“VDMH”). The Heads of Terms envisaged that the parties would enter into a detailed loan agreement. Although a loan agreement between Mr Taylor on the one hand and (i) Van Dutch Marine Limited </p>

The loan matured on 26 January 2016, but was not repaid. On 17 May 2016 Mr Taylor commenced proceedings against the Original Defendants. On 2 August 2016 Mr Taylor obtained a default judgment against the Original Defendants for the amount of the loan, contractual interest to date and further damages to be assessed. The default judgment remains wholly unsatisfied. </p>

These claims were tried by Julia Dias QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in April and June 2019. On 22 July 2019 the Judge handed down an impressive judgment ([2019] EWHC 1951 (Ch)) running to 323 paragraphs dismissing all of Mr Taylor’s claims. </p>

It expressly recorded that the IP rights, moulds and tools were owned by Rhino. The Judge found that the whole basis of the business had been changed in 2013, with production in the Netherlands ceasing and all manufacturing operations being moved to the USA.  The 2013 agreement was subsequently replaced by an agreement dated 4 May 2015 which recorded that VDML owned and had exclusive rights to the moulds and tools, and did not mention Rhino. A French manufacturer was added in 2015.  </p>

The Judge found that Rhino was beneficially owned by Mr Khodabakhsh/NBT from that date, although the shares in Rhino were not formally registered in the name of NBT until 25 January 2017. </p>

He submitted that this language meant exactly what it said. Accordingly, he argued, it extended to a short-term bridging loan at a high rate of interest. Furthermore, it was irrelevant that the Heads of Terms included security that VDML was not in a position to promise either on its own behalf or on behalf of Rhino, since that merely meant that Mr Taylor had a claim for misrepresentation. </p>

They cannot sensibly have been intended to give VDML carte blanche to enter into any loan agreement whatever, no matter how onerous its terms and regardless of whether VDML or Rhino were able to perform its terms. The Judge drew the line at borrowing “in the ordinary course of” the Business. I accept that those words are not to be found in clause 3(b), but in my view the Judge was right to hold that they were implicit.  </p>

The Judge accepted the first part of this proposition, and for my part I accept the whole of it. As the Judge rightly held, however, it does not necessarily follow that the Nominee Agreement superseded the Agency Agreement. As she pointed out, that is not what it says. Nor is it a necessary implication because the two agreements are not entirely co-extensive. The Judge construed the Nominee Agreement as being directed specifically at the assets owned by Rhino, and as such it displaced the Agency Agreement to that extent but no further. That left the Agency Agreement applying generally to the distribution and sale of boats by VDML. In my opinion the Judge’s analysis is correct, and none of the submissions made by counsel for Rhino persuade me to the contrary.     </p>

I agree that this does not appear to challenge the correctness of the Judge’s contractual analysis, particularly given that the Judge dealt with that quite separately from her analysis of the extent of VDML’s agency; but paragraphs 59-65 of Mr Taylor’s skeleton argument on the application for permission to appeal made it clear that Mr Taylor was also challenging the contractual analysis.

On the contrary, Mr Taylor’s pleaded case is that the contract was a written one contained in the Heads of Terms.

First, he relied upon the intrinsic evidence, namely the terms of the agreement, read against the background matrix of fact. He pointed out that the Heads of Terms granted Mr Taylor an option to purchase two boats and a charge over three stock boats “owned by the Company”. He submitted that, since VDMH was merely a holding company and VDML was the trading company, the boats must have been owned by VDML, and this showed that “the Company” must be VDML. This does not necessarily follow, however. As Underhill LJ pointed out during the course of argument, a parent company may agree to procure that its wholly-owned subsidiary grants an option to purchase and/or a charge over property owned by the latter.  </p>

The first item was that the loan monies were paid to Marquis and that this was for the benefit of VDML given that the Marquis invoices were addressed to VDML. As counsel for Rhino submitted, however, this does not demonstrate that VDML was a contracting party. Again, there was nothing to prevent VDMH from directing that the monies be paid for the benefit of its subsidiary.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The post-contractual conduct relied upon consists of the Loan Agreement, which the Judge found had been drafted (to the extent that it was) by Mr Taylor’s lawyers. As noted above, this names VDML as a party, has provisions concerning VDML and was executed by VDML. The short answer to this point, however, is that the Loan Agreement was never concluded. At best, therefore, it represents an offer by the Van Dutch parties which was not accepted by Mr Taylor. The fact that it evidently shows that, at that point in time, Mr Taylor was minded to contract with VDML (and Messrs Erenstein and Koekkoek) as well as VDMH does not show that, at the date of the Heads of Terms, the parties intended that VDML was to be a party to that agreement even though it was not named as such. </p>

A similar issue arose to that considered above as to whether it was open to Mr Taylor to challenge that conclusion. Mr Taylor’s ground of appeal was that the Judge “wrongly misapplied, and erroneously misidentified the rationale and justification for the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Kendall v Hamilton</span>”. Again, however, I consider that paragraphs 44-51 of Mr Taylor’s skeleton argument made it clear that he was challenging the judge’s conclusion on election, and Rose LJ must be taken to have given him permission to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These factors explain why I do not consider that it would be desirable to prolong this judgment by considering the second ground of appeal. It is sufficient to say that the application to adduce further evidence must in any event be dismissed having regard to the failure of Mr Taylor’s first ground of appeal.        </p>

It is rather surprising for this Court to be complaining that grounds of appeal are too succinct: usually, as Arnold LJ says, the problem is that they are far too discursive.  But grounds do need to identify (though they should not develop) the specific errors which the Judge is said to have made, and that includes any errors of fact on which the appellant seeks to rely.  The careful analysis which this may require should be as useful to the pleader as it will be to the </p>
