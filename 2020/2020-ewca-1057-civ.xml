By that order the judge refused to set aside a return order that she had previously made on 25 September 2019 under the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention (“the 1980 Convention”) by which she had ordered the mother to return the parties’ child (“B”) to Bosnia Herzegovina (“Bosnia”) by 9 October 2019 (“the September 2019 order”).   </p>

B was born in England in February 2017 and so is now three years old.  The father stayed in England for the first six weeks of B’s life and then returned to Bosnia.  The mother and B went to Bosnia in May 2017.  The mother left B in the care of the father for a four-week period in July/August 2017 when she returned to England.  She then went back to Bosnia.

She travelled back to England for two weeks to attend medical appointments with her mother, leaving B with the father.  The mother then went on holiday with her own mother and returned to London before travelling to Bosnia at the end of April 2018. </p>

The mother sought assistance from the British Embassy in Sarajevo.  In September 2018 the mother, father and B went on holiday to Croatia.

She followed them to the father’s mother’s flat seeking B’s return, whereupon the father beat her.  The father was arrested, and social services placed the mother and B in a women’s shelter.  On the following day the Municipal Court in Sarajevo, having made a finding that the father was violent to the mother, placed a restraining order on the father for 12 months preventing him from going within 500 metres of the mother’s address and from using or threatening violence against her or from harassing or intimidating her (“the restraining order”).  At this point the mother was able to attend the father’s flat with police and, amongst other things, obtain B’s passport. </p>

The application was “primarily based on a deterioration in her mental health and her assertion that as a result she simply could not cope if she was required to return to Bosnia with B”.  Article 13(b) was said to be engaged because the impact on her mental health would expose B to a grave risk of harm and place him in an intolerable situation.

She found (at paragraph 34) the mother’s statement to be “both revealing and puzzling”: revealing in that it evidenced a deep resistance to the September order and puzzling in that by 18 October 2019 the mother had taken the firm stance that she would not go back to Bosnia “because she took the view that she was unable to cope.”  This was puzzling because at “that time she asserted that it was owing to the mental health crisis she was experiencing” but she maintained this position even as her mental health had stabilised. </p>

The judge summarised other aspects of Dr Ratnam’s evidence including that if B were living with the father on the mother’s and his return to Bosnia “this would lead to a significant deterioration of the mother’s mental health”; and that it was “likely that there would be increased difficulty regulating her emotions”. </p>

She explained how the deterioration in the mother’s mental health, of which the court was aware in September, has impacted in the immediate and longer term.  There are in my view two key elements which emerge from her report. Firstly although the mother’s mental health has deteriorated and that she is symptomatic, it has stabilized and Dr Ratnam considers the mother could obtain the assistance she needs in Bosnia and that she could engage with professional support there. Secondly, her mental health will be adversely affected by her perception that the undertakings are not solid, by the absence of her own mother and by her fear of the father.

She said that the question of whether the father had breached the undertaking not to seek to separate B from the mother’s care was not a simple issue when seen in the context of the Bosnian proceedings as a whole, in which the mother had chosen not to participate.  She had “robbed herself” of the opportunity to explain in Bosnia what arrangements she thought were best for B.  The judge accepted that the father had “gone behind” the undertaking by continuing actively to invite the Bosnian court to determine his application for custody.

The judge concluded that, objectively, it was “reasonable” for the father to “seek to progress” the case in Bosnia and he could not be criticised for having “set in motion the steps which led to” the CSS order.

She lived there most recently for a year in 2018, and she travelled easily between there and England during the course of the year.

She considered it more important that they had been given “in good faith” by the father.

She saw no reason to take the view that the father could not provide an adequate standard of care.  She did not consider that the return of B to Bosnia into his father’s care would be an intolerable situation for him.

She declined to suspend the return order on the basis of a request dated 10 February 2020 by the Bosnian Municipal Court to Islington Social Services for an assessment of the mother’s ability to care for B in the context of determining with whom B should live and what parental contact he should have.  She noted that the father confirmed that he would make no complaint against the mother and not seek to execute the CSS order; he had withdrawn his criminal complaint.  He also offered to provide funding for two months’ accommodation for the mother.  She ordered the father to confirm these matters in a short sworn statement and the mother to confirm in writing that she has not made a criminal complaint against the father.  The judge declined to delay enforcement of the return order pending further enquiries of the Bosnian judge seised of the case, and made directions for the handover of B to the father on the earliest possible date after 19 March but not later than 1 April 2020. </p>

Although “grave” characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.

As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re D</span>  [2007] 1 AC 619, at para 52, “‘Intolerable’ is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean ‘a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate’”. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e g, where a mother’s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.” </p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home.

Further, where an application for rehearing has been issued, the court will case-manage it tightly so that only those applications that have a sufficient prospect of success are allowed to proceed and then only within parameters determined by the court.” </p>

Indeed, it may be possible, when the developments or changes relied upon are clear and already evidenced, for all four stages to be addressed at one hearing.  More typically, I would expect there to be a preliminary hearing when the court decides the issues under (a) and (b), followed by a hearing at which it determines the issues under (c) and (d).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">The father’s breach also highlights the fact that, as clarified by the evidence of Mr Kovacevic, undertakings to this court are not enforceable in Bosnia until recognised by the courts there and the mother, therefore, has no available remedies in Bosnia for any breach of the undertakings until then.  As a result, their efficacy depended on the father voluntarily complying with them.  This is relevant because of the importance attached to the robustness of the undertakings by Dr Ratnam for the purposes of safeguarding the mother’s mental health.  As set out above, in her opinion they needed to be “rock solid”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, the judge was, therefore, wrong to discount the effect of the father’s breach of his undertaking based on her conclusions as to the father’s “motivation” and her assessment that he could not be criticised for the breach.  Even though I disagree with the judge’s conclusions in that respect, in any event, the relevance of the breach was the consequential impact on the mother’s mental health as analysed by Dr Ratnam and not whether objectively the father’s conduct could be explained or excused. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In this respect, the judge also discounted Dr Ratnam’s evidence as to the need for the undertakings to be “rock solid” because, as the judge put it, undertakings are “not meant to provide a long-term solution” and are “by their nature temporary”.  I do not propose to address the role of undertakings when the court is determining an application under the 1980 Convention (and would simply refer to what is said, at [47], in the <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Good Practice</span> about the need for caution).  However, I consider that the judge was wrong to conclude that she “cannot place too much emphasis on Dr Ratnam’s expectation” about the relevance of the undertakings to the mother’s mental health.  She was wrong because, as she went on to say, “if the mother perceives </p>

The relevance of the father’s breach was the consequential impact on the mother which did not depend on whether, from a legal perspective, the undertakings were temporary.  This was a mental health issue, not a legal issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Next, the mother’s case in respect of her mental health was based on the effect of her returning to Bosnia.  This was, in part, connected with the father’s breach of his undertaking and was founded on Dr Ratnam’s evidence.  With respect to the judge, it appears to me that, in considering this issue, she fell into the error addressed by Lord Wilson, at [27] and [34], in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span>.  As Lord Wilson said, the “critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned”.  Although the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the “mother’s anxieties” and/or the fact that they are not based on an objective risk may lead “a court [to] look very critically” at the case advanced by the mother, neither of these elements prevent the court from determining that “the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child”.  It is clear that “subjective perception” can be sufficient. </p>

With respect to the judge, I would suggest that this was the wrong order.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition, I consider that the judge’s approach to the issue of the mother’s mental health was flawed in a number of other respects.  As the Supreme Court made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span>, Article 13(b) is “looking to the future” so that the critical issue in the present case was the potential effect on the mother’s mental health of a return to Bosnia.  Applying this approach, I do not consider that, the fact that “by the time of this hearing the mother’s mental health was stable”, supports the judge’s conclusion, at paragraph 100, that “her case as to a fundamental change of circumstances is [not] made out”.  The question was, not whether the mother was stable at that time, but what would happen if she went with B to Bosnia. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Accordingly, the judge’s reference to the fact that the mother was “stable” did not address the critical, forward-looking, issue of the effect on the mother’s mental health of a return to Bosnia.  If the judge had looked at the mother’s mental health from this perspective she would, inevitably, have concluded that returning to Bosnia would be likely to lead to the mother feeling threatened, not feeling safe and, as a result, not being able to access treatment.  This would result in the emotional dysregulation described by Dr Ratnam and the consequent effect on her ability to care for B. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">I also consider that the judge, at paragraph 103, misdescribed Dr Ratnam’s evidence when she said that she accepted “Dr Ratnam’s view that the mother would access support” in Bosnia.  This was not the effect of Dr Ratnam’s evidence.  Similarly, I am not sure what led the judge to conclude, also at paragraph 103, that she had “no reason to think that [the mother] could not or would not” engage with mental health professionals if she returned to Bosnia.  </p>

She “had been the victim of domestic violence” and was fearful of the father.  As Dr Ratnam explained, the “degree of impact on her parenting will depend on if she is able to access available treatment” which, in turn, depended on the father’s assurances being enforceable.  Dr Ratnam’s clear evidence was that “unless [the mother] feels safe from [the father], she will not be able to engage effectively in intervention”.  This was why the efficacy of the father’s undertakings needed to be clear; this was “imperative”. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">In my view, the clear effect of Dr Ratnam’s evidence was that there was, at least, a significant risk that the mother’s mental health would significantly deteriorate if she were to return with B to Bosnia.  In fact, I consider that her evidence established that the mother’s mental health would be likely significantly to deteriorate.  Based on the fact that the undertakings had been clearly demonstrated to be far from “rock solid”, this meant that the mother would continue to feel under threat from the father which, as described by Dr Ratnam, “will impact adversely on her mental health”.  Because she would not feel safe, the mother would not be able to engage effectively with mental health services in Bosnia.  As the mother would not be able to access treatment, this would clearly have a significant impact on her parenting, for the reasons given by Dr Ratnam.  Put another way, it was not enough for there to be services in Bosnia that would be available to the mother when the mother’s mental health would not allow her to be psychologically available to benefit from such services. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, and contrary to the judge’s conclusion, in my view it was, therefore, understandable why the mother had concluded that she could not cope if she were to return to Bosnia.  The judge had rejected this because “I do not objectively accept that to be the case”.  Even though I consider the judge was wrong to reach this conclusion, because of the effect of Dr Ratnam’s evidence, in reaching this conclusion the judge, as required by <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span>, also failed properly to apply her assessment that “subjectively the mother perceives these fears to be insurmountable”.  These fears meant that the mother’s decision was not her “choice” as described by the judge. </p>

These comprised the breach by the father of his undertaking, the evidence given by Dr Ratnam as to the effect on the mother’s mental health if she returned to Bosnia and the mother’s consequent decision that she could not return to Bosnia.  The judge should therefore have found that the mother had satisfied stage (c) of the process set out above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Turning to stage (d), in my view it is equally clear that there would be a grave risk of B being placed in an intolerable situation based on the prospective significant deterioration in the mother’s mental health if she were to return to Bosnia and their prospective separation.  To adopt what Lord Wilson said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span>, the “effect on [the mother’s] mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for” B.  Dr Ratnam was clear that it was “essential” that the mother “feels safe from threat” and that “the undertakings needed to be ‘rock solid’ and that B would be with the mother”.  This was “the basis upon which she had reached the view that the mother could engage with mental health services in Bosnia”.  There was no reason for the mother to view the undertakings as being rock solid nor for her not to fear B being separated from her.  As referred to above, the likely detrimental effect on the mother’s mental health was clearly established by Dr Ratnam’s evidence.  Nor should it be forgotten that, regardless of whether or not the father had acted with good faith with regard to his undertaking, there would be every prospect of heavily contested custody proceedings in Bosnia, which on Dr Ratnam’s evidence would be likely to destabilise the mother’s mental health.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, I can also see no basis on which it could be suggested that, because the mother’s mental health would suffer in this way, B should be returned to Bosnia without her.  To be fair to Mr Jarman, he did not suggest this, but based his argument on the judge’s assessment that the mother’s decision not to return was her “choice”.  As set out above, I disagree with the characterisation of the mother’s decision in this way.  In any event, the father’s case and the judge’s decision were based on the mother being unwilling rather than unable to return to Bosnia.  It has never been suggested nor, in my view, could it be suggested that a return order should be made notwithstanding Article 13(b) having been established.   That would not be a proper use of the 1980 Convention in this case. </p>
