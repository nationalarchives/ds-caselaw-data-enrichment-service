One of the areas in which the law applicable in Wales is no longer identical to that which applies in England is private rented housing. The Housing (Wales) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) passed by the National Assembly for Wales (“the Assembly”) includes provision for the regulation of landlords and their agents which has no parallel in England. Among other things, the regime requires landlords to be registered in respect of any dwelling let under a “domestic tenancy” and to be licensed to carry out either lettings activities or property management activities for dwellings the subject of “domestic tenancies”. The present appeal relates to the scope of the licensing requirement and the consequences of failing to comply with it. Must a landlord be licensed to serve a notice under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”)? If he must, is a notice served by an unlicensed landlord nugatory? </p>

Possession proceedings followed in December 2018.

At that stage, Mr and Mrs Evans contended that they had undertaken renovation works for which they were entitled to credit, but the District Judge concluded that on their own case there was “a significant amount outstanding well above two months’ rent” and that that “makes out the mandatory ground for possession”. He considered that there was no real prospect of expenditure on some adjoining land affecting “The Leys” and, as regards that property, said this: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal was heard by Her Honour Judge Garland-Thomas, sitting in the County Court at Swansea, on 20 August 2019. Giving judgment the same day, she allowed the Evans’ appeal. She noted in her judgment that Mr Jarvis had not been registered as landlord of “The Leys” until July 2019 and had been licensed only “within the last few weeks”. While, therefore, a company of which he was a director was already licensed, Mr Jarvis was not himself registered or licensed when the section 8 notice was served. That meant, Judge Garland-Thomas held, that the section 8 notice was ineffective. Her core reasoning can be seen from paragraph 9 of her judgment, in which she said: </p>

The [2014] Act was brought into effect or more particularly, these sections of the Act were brought into effect to protect tenants from landlords who were unregistered and unlicensed and it seems to me that there is no reason why Section 8 should not come within that Act. There is nothing which excludes Section 8; it is simply that it is not specifically mentioned. However, the wording of Section 7, in my judgment, is clear and it is clear that the landlord of a dwelling subject to a domestic tenancy must not or cannot serve notice to terminate a tenancy, it is not qualified in any way.” </p>

The notice itself does not do anything to the tenancy. Aside from the exceptional cases mentioned in section 5(1)(b)-(d) of the 1988 Act, a landlord cannot bring an assured tenancy to an end except by obtaining and executing a possession order and “the service by the landlord of a notice to quit is of no effect in relation to a periodic tenancy” (see section 5(1) and (1A)). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Bates pointed out that, if (contrary to his case) an unlicensed landlord were prohibited from serving a section 8 notice, the landlord could instead issue proceedings seeking possession on any of the schedule 2 grounds other than grounds 7A, 7B and 8 and ask the Court to dispense with the requirement of a notice under section 8(1)(b) of the 1988 Act. The fact that possession can be obtained without any section 8 notice would, Mr Bates suggested, render a bar on serving one largely meaningless. Mr Bates also relied on the fact that section 44 of the 2014 Act specifically states that a notice under section 21 of the 1988 Act may not be given by a landlord who is not licensed. There would have been no need so to provide, Mr Bates said, if section 7(2)(f) had not been limited in the way for which he contended, since a section 21 notice would, like a section 8 notice, have been a “notice to terminate a tenancy”. Finally, Mr Bates referred to the forms prescribed for use in possession proceedings. He explained that form N5B Wales, which is applicable </p>

The distinction, Mr Bates submitted, reflects the fact that, while a landlord is obliged by section 44 to be licensed if he is to serve a section 21 notice, there is no requirement for a landlord serving a section 8 notice to have a licence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On the other hand, in the first place, the words “notice to terminate a tenancy” are apt to refer to a section 8 notice. Had the Assembly intended to confine section 7(2)(f) of the 2014 Act to notices which themselves terminated tenancies, it could have said so more explicitly, by speaking, say, of “notice terminating a tenancy” or “notice which terminates a tenancy”. It did not do so. The language it chose to adopt instead is perfectly capable of being understood as encompassing notices which are served in order to bring tenancies to an end but which do not achieve that of themselves. A section 8 notice is of that kind. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, section 7(2)(f) of the 2014 Act would be all but nugatory if limited to notices which themselves terminated tenancies. The provision would have no application to assured tenancies, which come to an end by the execution of orders for possession, not by the service of notices. It is true that, by virtue of section 2(1)(b) of the 2014 Act, a “regulated tenancy for the purposes of the Rent Act 1977” will also be a “domestic tenancy” and that a Rent Act “protected tenancy” (which is a kind of “regulated tenancy”) can potentially be terminated by service of a notice to quit. However, Rent Act tenancies were already rare by the time the 2014 Act was passed and, moreover, a tenant whose “protected tenancy” is terminated immediately becomes a “statutory tenant” under section 2 of the Rent Act. It therefore seems unlikely section 7(2)(f) was included in the 2014 Act with Rent Act tenancies in mind. Mr Bates pointed out that section 2(1)(c) of the 2014 Act allows the Welsh Ministers to enlarge the definition of “domestic tenancy” and suggested that tenancies so added might well be susceptible to termination by notice to quit. It seems to me, however, that the Assembly is unlikely to have inserted section 7(2)(f) against the possibility that the power conferred by section 2(1)(c) might be exercised in the future in such a way as to make section 7(2)(f) useful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">That leads to a third point: that the structure and purpose of the 2014 Act suggest that the Assembly would have wished to apply section 7 to the service of notices under section 8 of the 1988 Act. As section 1 explains, the 2014 Act “regulates  … the management of dwellings subject to [domestic] tenancies” and requires landlords to be licensed “to carry out certain kinds of property management activities”. Those activities can be seen from section 7 to include, for example, “collecting rent”, “making arrangements with a person to carry out repairs or maintenance” and, even on Mr Bates’ case, the service of certain notices. Service of a section 8 notice seems to me to fall naturally within the scope of such “property management activities”. Or, putting things slightly differently, why should the Assembly have intended section 7 to apply to, say, a notice to quit but not a section 8 notice, the more so since service of a notice to quit could be expected to be of little significance even in the context of a Rent Act tenancy? </p>

The Court cannot dispense with a section 8 notice as regards ground 7A, ground 7B or, more importantly, ground 8 (see section 8(5) of the 1988 Act). Even where there is power to dispense with a section 8 notice, the Court will do so only if it considers that to be “just and equitable” in the particular circumstances. In <span style="font-style:italic">Braintree DC v Vincent </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 415, Neuberger LJ said at paragraph 14 of a comparable power to dispense with the requirement of a notice that “it is obviously only in relatively exceptional cases where the court should be prepared to dispense with a section 83 notice”. </p>

Moreover, the fact that form N5B Wales asks about licensing when forms N5 and N119 do not can potentially be explained on the basis that form N5B Wales is used in the context of an accelerated possession procedure under which claims are often dealt with without a hearing (see CPR 55.15, CPR 55.16 and <span style="font-style:italic">Manel v Memon </span>(2001) 33 HLR 24, at paragraph 38). </p>

It is perhaps worth adding that that conclusion does not prevent an unlicensed landlord from arranging for an authorised agent to serve a section 8 notice on his behalf and that, in this particular context, the “authorised agent” can be a solicitor (see section 7(7)). </p>

Section 7(5) provides that a landlord who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine. It is nowhere stated, Mr Bates pointed out, that a notice served in contravention of section 7 is ineffective. That criminal and civil consequences need to be distinguished is confirmed, so Mr Bates contended, by section 43. That section stipulates that, without prejudice to the possibility of rent stopping orders and rent repayment orders, “No rule of law relating to the validity or enforceability of contracts in circumstances involving illegality is to affect the validity or enforceability of any provision of a domestic tenancy of a dwelling in respect of which a contravention of this Part has occurred”. Contractual provisions are thus to remain valid and enforceable despite contravention of, for example, section 7.

Any prosecution has to be brought by a licensing or housing authority and a fixed penalty notice can be given only by someone authorised by a licensing authority. Similarly, it is a licensing or housing authority that can apply for a rent stopping order and, while an application for a rent repayment order can be made by a tenant as well as by a licensing or housing authority, there must have been a prior conviction or rent repayment order in the case of an application by a tenant. Yet the Assembly will have been aware when enacting the 2014 Act, which was evidently designed to benefit tenants, that local authorities have many other demands on limited resources. That tends to suggest that the Assembly would not have wished to leave tenants dependent on local authorities and, hence, that it would not have intended a notice served in contravention of section 7 to be effective; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">It is plain from the 2014 Act that contractual obligations are not negated by breaches of its registration and licensing regime. Section 43(1) states in terms that “No rule of law relating to the validity or enforceability of contracts in circumstances involving illegality is to affect the validity or enforceability of any provision of a domestic tenancy of a dwelling in respect of which a contravention of this Part has occurred”. More specifically, it is implicit in section 30 that a tenant remains liable for rent unless and until a rent stopping order under the section provides otherwise (at which point “an obligation … to pay an amount stopped by the order is treated as being met” – see section 30(3)(b)). Again, there can be no question of a landlord being excused from maintenance obligations under the tenancy on the basis that section 7(2)(c) bars him from “making arrangements with a person to carry repairs or maintenance” (the more so since section 7(1) leaves a landlord free to arrange for an authorised agent to do something on his behalf). Somewhat cryptically, perhaps, section 43 even refers to the <span style="font-style:italic">enforceability</span> of a provision of a tenancy being unaffected, which, taken at face value, might indicate that an unlicensed landlord can bring proceedings to recover outstanding rent despite the fact that, by virtue of section 7(2)(a), he is prohibited from “collecting rent” (though it is by no means clear that that means that he is barred from merely <span style="font-style:italic">receiving </span>rent, say, pursuant to a standing order). Be that as it may, however, what is at issue on this appeal is not the validity or enforceability of any provision of a tenancy, but rather whether a notice served in compliance with a statutory provision is effective.

A section 21 notice served by an unlicensed landlord will, I think, be invalidated by section 7 as well as section 44. That prompts the question: why was section 44 inserted into what became the Act? As, however, Miss Salmon pointed out, section 44 addresses section 21 notices served by unregistered landlords as well as unlicensed ones. It is, moreover, to be found in a group of sections with the heading, “Supplementary”. On top of that, as Mr Bates recognised, the report of the Assembly’s Communities, Equality and Local Government Committee which recommended provisions to the effect of what is now section 44 does not explain the Committee’s reasoning in any detail. In the circumstances, section 44 is, as it seems to me, best seen as a belt-and-braces provision in so far as it relates to unlicensed (as opposed to unregistered) landlords. I do not think it should be inferred from its inclusion in the 2014 Act that a notice served in breach of section 7(2)(f) was intended to be effective. </p>
