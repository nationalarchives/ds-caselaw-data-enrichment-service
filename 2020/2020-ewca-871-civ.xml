	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is an appeal, brought with the permission of the judge, from an order of Nugee J dated 5 June 2019 that UK Patent No 2 490 276 (“GB 276”) and European Patent (UK) No 2 657 585 (“EP 585”) (collectively “the Patents”), which are exclusively licensed to the Appellant (“Emson”), be revoked on the ground that all the claims were obvious over US Patent Application No. 2003/0000530 (“McDonald”) for the reasons given in the judge’s judgment dated 17 April 2019 [2019] EWHC 991 (Pat). The appeal challenges that conclusion. The judge also held that (i) the Patents were entitled to their claimed priority date of 4 November 2011, (ii) the Patents were valid over certain prior uses by the inventor Michael Berardi while reducing the invention to practice in his garden and (iii) if they were valid, the Patents had been infringed by the First Respondent (“Hozelock”). Hozelock challenges those conclusions by a respondent’s notice. The current and former owners of the Patents are formally respondents to the appeal, but have played no part in the proceedings. </p>

Despite that, his invention has transformed the garden hose industry in that it resulted in the introduction of an entirely new type of garden hose which solved long-standing problems with previous garden hoses (which is not to say that the Xhose has displaced conventional hoses – on the contrary, there continues to be a substantial market for the latter).     </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Blue Gentian LLC v Tristar Products (UK) Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 4098 (Pat) Birss J held that GB 276 was valid, including over McDonald, and had been infringed by the defendants. His conclusions were upheld by this Court: [2015] EWCA Civ 746. As the judge in the present case correctly noted at [40], strictly speaking the previous decisions are not admissible evidence on any question of fact arising in the present case. As he said, his function was to decide this case on the evidence adduced by parties in this case. Moreover, as he explained, the evidence in this case was materially different to that in the previous case. I shall return to this point more than once below. </p>

After describing the field of the invention in general terms, without reference to garden water hoses, the background section (paragraphs [0003] and [0004]) describes problems encountered with garden hoses. The problems identified relate to storage, such as the need for a reel or a container and relate to tangling, kinking and the weight of the hose. The patent states that it would be of great benefit to have a hose that is light in weight, contractable in length and kink resistant.   </p>

The detailed description section including figures 1 to 11 runs from paragraphs [0031] to [0063]. Although the specification is written in general terms and contemplates that other fluids apart from water could be used, the claims are clearly limited to a garden water hose. The skilled reader would understand that while the inventor no doubt has contemplated that his idea might be applicable in other fields, the invention claimed is directed to a garden water hose. </p>

The outer tube is secured to the inner tube only at the ends.  The hose expands when connected to a pressurised water supply such as a water tap (faucet). The hose can expand longitudinally up to six times its length and width. On release of the pressurised water from the inner tube, the inner tube will contract. The inner tube could be made of rubber while the outer tube could be made of a non-elastic relatively soft fabric like woven nylon. Figures 9 and 5 and figures 10 and 6 show the invention in its unexpanded and in its expanded states: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.02in;margin-right:0.52in;text-indent:0.5in">In the unexpanded state, when not connected to water pressure, the inner tube is in a relaxed condition. There are no forces being applied to expand or stretch it. It has a relatively narrow diameter. In this state the outer tube is ruffled. When the hose is connected to a water supply and the supply turned on, water pressure expands the rubber inner tube. The inner tube will expand laterally (also referred to as radially or circumferentially) and will also expand axially (i.e. along the length of the hose). As the inner tube expands the wall thickness of the inner tube material reduces, in other words the material gets thinner. The radial expansion is constrained by the diameter of the outer tube. The axial expansion is constrained by the length of the outer tube. As the water inflates the inner tube, the hose expands lengthways and the ruffles of the outer tube unfurl until it is smooth (see fig 10).  In this state the hose can be used. The hose contains a flow restrictor, which can be a small disc with a narrower bore than the bore of the hose.    </p>

At the same time the hose in its relaxed condition allows easy storage of the mask assembly, both originally and after use of the mask. Furthermore, given that the hose is secured to a connector within the box 16, after use the hose will ‘retract’ itself and the oxygen mask back into box 16.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:0.52in">“186.   I have now considered all the detailed points made by Mr Hinchliffe, and can return to the overall question whether it would have been obvious to the skilled hose designer to take the McDonald hose and adapt it for use as a garden water hose. Mr Hinchliffe submitted that it would not be as the McDonald hose is in a specialist and remote field, does not look remotely like a garden hose, is made in part from an elastomeric and unfamiliar material, and has numerous details unexplained.  But standing back from the detailed points, I am left with Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence, which I accept, that the general hose designer would be well used to designing hoses for both liquids and gases, and would have no difficulty in appreciating that the way in which the McDonald hose works, that is by being pressure-actuated, does not depend on the type of fluid used – nor, I would add, on the particular application which McDonald describes. In those circumstances I also accept his conclusion that the skilled person would indeed immediately see that the construction described in McDonald could also be used to make expandable hoses for other fluids in other situations, including a water hose for use in gardens.  That conclusion does not seem to me to be based on an impermissible use of hindsight. Once he has made that connection, the skilled person would, as Mr Hinchliffe accepted in closing, readily be able to make all the necessary adaptations to turn the McDonald hose into a garden water hose without doing anything inventive.   </p>

That may seem hard on Mr Berardi who is undoubtedly inventive and who I have no reason to doubt came up with his idea entirely independently of McDonald, but if there is prior art, however obscure, which discloses either the same invention, or something which would lead the skilled person to the same invention, then patent protection is for good reasons unavailable.”     </p>

He held, however, that this did not show that the invention was not obvious over McDonald, because there was no evidence that McDonald was known to hose designers. Indeed, the only relevant evidence (Mr Doosterlinck’s acceptance that he did not regularly review patents from the aerospace industry) went the other way. </p>

If the invention is obvious to that person in the light of a particular piece of prior art, the claim in invalid. It is no answer to say that in real life the prior art would never have come to the attention of a worker in the field, for example because it was tucked away on the top shelf of a public library or because it was in a language which nobody in the art knew. The notional skilled person is assumed to have read and understood the contents of the prior art. However that does not mean that all prior art will be considered equally interesting. The notional skilled person is assumed to be interested in the field of technology covered by the patent in suit, but he is not assumed to know or suspect in advance of reading it that any particular piece of prior art has the answer to a problem he faces or is relevant to it. He comes to the prior art without any preconceptions and, in particular, without any expectation that it offers him a solution to any problem he has in mind. Some pieces of prior art will be much more interesting than others. A document directed at solving the particular problem at issue will be seized upon by the skilled addressee. Its very contents may suggest that it is a worthwhile starting point for further development. But the same may not be the case where a document comes, say, from a distant and unrelated field. For example, in theory a notional skilled person engaged in trying to improve the operation of an internal combustion engine is assumed to know, have read and assimilated the contents of all published material including those, say, in the baking field. It may be that a document in the latter field discloses something which, if applied to the internal combustion art, would produce a marked improvement in performance. However, the person skilled in the art is not deemed to read the baking document in the knowledge, or even with a suspicion, that it is of significance to the problems he has to deal with. It may be that it is written in such a way that, although he understands it, the skilled person will dismiss it as irrelevant to his work. The more distant a prior art document is from the field of technology covered by the patent, the greater the chance that an intelligent but uninventive person skilled in the art will fail to make the jump to the solution found by the patentee.” 44.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Having referred to this passage, the judge said at [177]: </p>

In fact I think these two issues are really treated by McDonald as facets of the same problem: what McDonald seeks to provide is a hose that is long enough to facilitate donning of the mask (see [0019]) but which when not in use can be stored compactly (see [0008]).  Mr Doosterlinck naturally accepted that garden hose designers were not operating under the same severe space constraints. But that does not mean that a space-saving hose would be regarded by a hose designer as irrelevant to garden hoses. On the contrary it is one, indeed the first, of the problems that the Patents are expressed to address: GB 276 starts off with a reference to the fact that a notable problem with conventional garden hoses relates to their storage, with many consumers not having room for a garden hose storage device [0003], and there being many situations where it is beneficial to store a hose in as little a space as possible [0004]. Indeed the corkscrew or helix garden hoses, although entirely different in design from the XHose, were also intended to address the need for a compact but extendable hose. Admittedly GB 276 also refers to two other problems with conventional hoses, their weight and tendency to kink, which are not referred to in McDonald (although McDonald at [0019] does refer to the hose not requiring the extent of gathering and coiling typical of conventional hose assemblies), but I do not think this undermines the fact that the skilled person would regard the space-saving advantages of McDonald as not limited to the particular demands of a flight deck but as potentially applicable more widely.” </p>

Leaving aside the point that this submission amounts to an attack on the judge’s findings of fact for which Emson has neither sought nor obtained permission, it goes nowhere because counsel accepted that there was evidence that garden hoses could be as small as 6 mm in diameter. Moreover, as the judge found, there is an overlap between the diameters of hoses used for breathable air and those used for watering gardens. In any event, the key point made by the judge was that the skilled person would not see the teaching of McDonald as being tied to any particular diameter. The absence of any disclosure of the diameter in McDonald supports that conclusion, rather than undermining it.

I agree that McDonald does not give any details on any of this, possibly because they would be familiar to a person designing oxygen masks for aircraft; and that they would not be familiar to ordinary hose designers. Mr Hurst suggested that this would be one of the factors causing the skilled person to put McDonald down as of no interest. But I do not understand why. The skilled person does not need to understand the correct gas pressures to make McDonald work safely and effectively in the context of crew oxygen masks as he is not interested in making such an assembly. All he needs to understand, as Mr Doosterlinck said, is that there is a higher pressure in the hose than 1 bar (or 1 atm, the two measures being very nearly the same) to enable pressure-activation to function. McDonald has a reference (at [0014]) to the mask including a ‘regulator’ (no 22 in Fig 1), and I see no reason to doubt Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence that although the skilled hose designer would not know the details of how this worked, he would understand that a regulator is a type of valve commonly used to restrict gas pressures, so that a higher pressure in the hose would be consistent with the regulator reducing the pressure of the oxygen reaching the pilot to about 1 atm. What is relevant is whether the skilled person would think it obvious to adapt the teaching to a water-filled garden hose. For that purpose he no doubt needs to understand that if you fill a hose with water and restrict the water leaving the hose, there will be a pressure inside the tube which will cause the tube, if made of an elastomeric material, to expand, but that requires no particular technical knowledge and seems to me well within most people’s everyday experience, and certainly that of a hose designer who is used to testing hoses.” </p>

Replacing oxygen with water would make no difference to this (as is confirmed by the fact that, as the skilled person would know from their common general knowledge, gas hoses are pressure-tested with water). Counsel for Emson particularly criticised the judge’s statement that the skilled person did not need to understand the correct oxygen pressures required to make McDonald work safely and effectively “as he is not interested in making [an oxygen mask assembly]”. This criticism is misconceived, however. For the purposes of the obviousness enquiry, the skilled person is deemed to be interested in solving the problems of space, weight and kinking with conventional garden hoses. The skilled person is then deemed to read McDonald, but without any preconception that it will assist him to solve any of those problems. The question is whether it would then be obvious to adopt the principles of McDonald’s hose for a garden hose.

I accept Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence.

First, Mr Hurst assumed that the oxygen pressure in the hose when it expanded was “about 1 bar”. Mr Doosterlinck disagreed with this, however, and gave a sound technical reason, namely that (as the judge accepted at [183], quoted above) the pressure had to exceed ambient pressure (1 atm, or approximately 1 bar) in order to make the hose expand. Mr Doosterlinck’s opinion was that the pressure would be 2-3 bar, although it could be as low as 1.5 bar, pressures which (as the judge accepted in [185]) were consistent with a garden water hose application. Secondly, as counsel for Hozelock pointed out, Mr Hurst accepted in cross-examination that, on the assumption that the skilled person had the attributes the judge ultimately found, the principle of how the hose in McDonald expanded and retracted would be clear to them: </p>

Not only is this consistent with Mr Hurst’s evidence quoted above, but also counsel for Emson did not put to Mr Doosterlinck any technical reason why it was wrong.

Moreover, as the judge noted at [165], Mr Doosterlinck accepted that he was unable to say whether the invention was obvious over Ragner without hindsight. As can be seen from the discussion above, the judge came to the conclusion that Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence with respect to McDonald was not infected by hindsight. It is well established that what matters is not the expert’s opinion, but the reasons the expert gives for that opinion. The judge carefully considered the reasons given by both Mr Hurst and Mr Doosterlinck for their respective opinions, and reached his conclusion after doing so. As I have explained, I consider that he was entitled to reach the conclusion he did. I would add two points. First, as the judge explained, Mr Doosterlinck accepted a number of the points which counsel for Emson put to him, and counsel relied upon those answers. That is inconsistent with the suggestion that the judge should have disregarded Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence with respect to McDonald. Secondly, counsel relied upon evidence given by Mr Doosterlinck on other issues as demonstrating a hindsight approach. What matters is his evidence about McDonald, however, particularly given that the judge did not accept that he should treat Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence generally with caution. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition to the submissions advanced by counsel for Emson, I wish to address three points which are relied upon by Floyd LJ, whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading, but which did not form part of counsel’s submissions. The first point is that McDonald is a “mere paper proposal” and therefore less likely to render the claimed invention obvious, referring to three authorities none of which were cited by counsel. Given that the submission was not made to this Court, it may be presumed that it was not made to the judge, and therefore he cannot be criticised for not dealing with it. That said, I accept that the fact that there is no evidence that McDonald was commercialised is a relevant consideration. But the force of that consideration depends crucially on two factors.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, if the prior art has been “long disregarded” (in the words of Jacob LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Grimme Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co KG v Scott</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1110, [2017] FSR 7 at </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">[59]), that invites the question as to why it has long been disregarded. As Jacob LJ pointed out in the same paragraph, the age of the prior art is a relevant consideration in considering obviousness: other things being equal, the older the prior art, the less likely it is to contain teaching which assists in solving current problems. This is reinforced if the prior art is known to those in the field, because it makes it more likely that skilled persons have not found it to be of assistance. In <span style="font-style:italic">Grimme</span> the prior art in question (Spatz) had been published as long ago as 1960 and was acknowledged in the patent. In the present case McDonald was only eight years old at the priority dates of the Patents; and the evidence was not that McDonald had been disregarded, but that, as discussed in more detail below, it was unknown to those in the hose industry.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, if the prior art has been “unused”, that invites the question as to why it has not been used, which may cast doubt on its teaching and/or the applicability of that teaching to the problem at hand. In <span style="font-style:italic">Grimme</span> not only had Spatz not been commercialised, but also the patent began by identifying problems with Spatz. In the present case it is a matter for speculation as to why McDonald was not commercialised, but the evidence did not establish that the reason for this was because the hose did not work. As noted above, although Mr Hurst queried whether it would work in its own context, not only was his query technically unsound, but also he accepted that the skilled person would understand the principle upon which McDonald was based. In any event, the cogency of McDonald’s teaching and the applicability of its solution to the problem at hand was explored in the evidence and the judge carefully analysed the evidence on these questions. I cannot see that in doing so he treated McDonald as a real, practical machine.        </p>

It is, of course, correct that there had been prior solutions to that problem, but: (i) there was no evidence that the skilled person would have regarded the problem of saving space as having been so successfully solved that it was no longer worth trying to come up with better solutions; (ii) in general, one way in which technology advances is by coming up with better solutions to problems; (iii) the Patents state that saving space is a problem to be solved; (iv) Emson’s own case is that the commercial success of the Xhose is attributable, at least in part, to its space-saving properties; and (v) the judge found as a fact that that was indeed the case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The third point is the suggestion that the allegation of obviousness involved a step-bystep analysis of the kind deprecated by Fletcher Moulton LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">British Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co Ltd v Braulik</span> (1910) 27 RPC 209 at 230 (“a series of apparently easy steps”) in a passage cited with approval by Lord Russell in <span style="font-style:italic">Non-Drip Measure Co Ltd v Strangers</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ltd</span> (1943) 60 RPC 135 at 142 and also by Lord Reid in <span style="font-style:italic">Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd v Mills &amp; Rockley (Electronics) Ltd</span> [1972] RPC 346 at 353. Where getting from the prior art to the claimed invention involves a number of steps, the dangers of hindsight are particularly acute even if each step is simple in itself. In the present case, however, it only requires a single step to get from McDonald to the claimed invention. Moreover, McDonald’s hose is as simple in conception as the hose described and claimed in the Patents.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Finally, I would echo and expand on what the judge said at [187]. Like the judge, I am sympathetic to the position of Mr Berardi; but that is not enough for Emson to prevail on this appeal. The judge referred to patent protection being unavailable where there is prior art which discloses the invention or makes it obvious “for good reasons” without elaborating on what those reasons were. There is a good deal of scholarly literature on the justifications for the patent system. In simple terms, however, the patent system aims to incentivise technical innovation, and investment in and disclosure of such innovation, by conferring limited monopolies. Monopolies are generally contrary to the public interest, however, because they prevent competition. Patent law contains a number of mechanisms which are designed to strike a balance between these conflicting considerations. Amongst these mechanisms are the requirements of novelty and inventive step (i.e. non-obviousness): in order not to fetter competition unduly, the public is deemed to have the right to do anything which is disclosed by, or obvious in the light of, any item of prior art, no matter how obscure, which was made available to the public anywhere in the world before the relevant date, without infringing a patent. For that reason, when attacking the validity of a patent, the party doing so is allowed to select the prior art used as the foundation for the argument with 20/20 hindsight. To that extent (but only to that extent), hindsight is not merely permitted, but an inherent feature of the current design of the European patent system (and indeed, of most patent systems worldwide). It inevitably follows that some patents turn out to be invalid because, unbeknownst to the inventor, or indeed other persons skilled in the relevant art, prior art emerges when sufficient searches are carried out which anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention. The judge concluded that this was such a case so far as obviousness over McDonald was concerned, and I see no basis on which this Court is entitled to interfere with that conclusion.                     </p>

But the important point, to my mind, is that McDonald unambiguously disclosed the same basic concept of an extensible and retractable hose as Mr Berardi’s later invention.  That concept was clearly expressed, both verbally and visually, in the original patent application for McDonald.  Bearing in mind that the notional skilled person was a designer of hoses in general, not just of garden hoses, and that he was familiar with the transposition of a hose structure from one application to another (see the judgment at [177]), it seems to </p>

The question of how to make the idea work in practice would not then have been a problem, because as every gardener knows the operation of a garden hose depends on nothing more sophisticated than its attachment at one end to a pressurised supply of water through an ordinary household tap. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I agree with Arnold LJ that the commercial success of the invention does not assist Emson in defeating the attack on the patent based on obviousness over McDonald.  The commercial success of the Mr Berardi’s invention was due to the fact that, viewed against the common general knowledge of garden hoses, the invention was one of breathtaking ingenuity bringing with it real practical advantages over what was available.  For commercial success to assist a patentee on the issue of obviousness, however, one needs to analyse how it bears on the particular allegation of obviousness under consideration.  The logic of the argument normally runs along the following lines.  First, the patentee has demonstrated that there are rich commercial rewards to be earned from exploiting the invention in the patent.  Secondly, the prior art over which the invention is said to be obvious has been available to the person skilled in the art for some time, yet no comparable device has ever been made.  Thirdly, it is said that the absence of such a device on the market in the period between the prior art and the patent cannot be explained if the invention were obvious over that document, when it is one which the skilled person must have been aware of. The argument is at its most powerful if the prior art relied on is held to be common general knowledge, but is nevertheless a factor to be taken into account if the prior art is merely known to some of those in the field in question.  The problem for the patentee in the present case is that the prior art fell into neither of these two categories.  As Arnold LJ has explained, it is a proposal for a breathing apparatus for the crew on an aircraft. The evidence was that such a document would not in the normal course come to the attention of the skilled but unimaginative person skilled in the art.  The absence of a comparable device on the market is thus readily explained by the fact that no real skilled person is ever likely to have seen it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is undoubtedly the law that an invention may have been published in, or rendered obvious by, a document which no person skilled in the art would ever be likely to have seen.  The award of a monopoly is not available if such a document exists and the person skilled in the art could have access to it, whether or not in the real world anybody would ever have taken that opportunity, or read it.   The policy justification for the rule, which is in essence a “deeming provision”, is that once the possibility exists that a skilled person could obtain the document and consider what to do in the light of it, a subsequent patent should not interfere with his freedom to take it forward, either as precisely directed by the document or in ways which are rendered obvious by it.    The policy justification does, however, lose its force in the situation, of which this case is an example,  where the evidence establishes positively that the person skilled in the art would not even look for the document. The net result of the application of the rule to such a case is that the person who delivers the benefit of the invention to the consuming public is deprived of his monopoly in order to protect a right which would never in fact be exercised. </p>

His view did not appeal to a majority of their Lordships, however.  The law must now be regarded as settled on this point.

A fiction in patent law is that the notional uninventive skilled man in the art is deemed to have read and assimilated any piece of prior art pleaded by the party attacking the patent claim. If the invention is obvious to that person in the light of a particular piece of prior art, the claim in invalid. It is no answer to say that in real life the prior art would never have come to the attention of a worker in the field, for example because it was tucked away on the top shelf of a public library or because it was in a language which nobody in the art knew. The notional skilled person is assumed to have read and understood the contents of the prior art. However that does not mean that all prior art will be considered equally interesting. The notional skilled person is assumed to be interested in the field of technology covered by the patent in suit, but he is not assumed to know or suspect in advance of reading it that any particular piece of prior art has the answer to a problem he faces or is relevant to it. He comes to the prior art without any preconceptions and, in particular, without any expectation that it offers him a solution to any problem he has in mind. Some pieces of prior art will be much more interesting than others. A document directed at solving the particular problem at issue will be seized upon by the skilled addressee. Its very contents may suggest that it is a worthwhile starting point for further development. But the same may not be the case where a document comes, say, from a distant and unrelated field. For example, in theory a notional skilled person engaged in trying to improve the operation of an internal combustion engine is assumed to know, have read and assimilated the contents of all published material including those, say, in the baking field. It may be that a document in the latter field discloses something which, if applied to the internal combustion art, would produce a marked improvement in performance. However, the person skilled in the art is not deemed to read the baking document in the knowledge, or even with a suspicion, that it is of significance to the problems he has to deal with. It may be that it is written in such a way that, although he understands it, the skilled person will dismiss it as irrelevant to his work. The more distant a prior art document is from the field of technology covered by the patent, the greater the chance that an intelligent but uninventive person skilled in the art will fail to make the jump to the solution found by the patentee.”  </p>

If the art is facing a particular unsolved problem, then a reading of a prior document from a wholly different field which suggests a specific solution to that problem may indeed cause the skilled person to seize on it.  But the same is not true merely because the remote document discusses a design consideration which is also a design consideration for his own field.  The skilled person may have common general knowledge ways of satisfying the design consideration in his field, so that achieving it is no longer a problem that he faces. </p>

First, when a prior document is examined in the context of an attack on the validity of a patent, the reader is aware of the invention.  Parts of the document which would be of no real significance to a reader unaware of the invention are suddenly focused on, and become important because they resemble the invention, or have some other similarity with the industry in which the invention was made.

Mr Hurst had expressed a perfectly understandable concern in paragraph 91 of his first report that, given that the air pressure in the tubing was likely to be only a little over one bar, the material of which it is made would have to exert little resistance to extension.  However, the last part of paragraph 19 of McDonald suggests that the elasticity of the hose significantly aids restowage.  For that purpose the elastic force exerted by the hose would have to be much greater than that which could be overcome by a pressure of approximately one bar.  As he explained, the skilled garden water hose designer would see a conflict between these properties, would be confused about how McDonald was meant to work and conclude that it had not been well thought out.  A possible explanation which occurred to him was that the extension was in fact caused by the aircrew member pulling the mask towards himself, so that the assembly did not have to rely entirely on pressure to extend it.   </p>

He then suggested that if this was sufficient to expand the hose, it must have very little resilience; and if it had very little resilience it would not selfretract.  Mr Doosterlinck said he did not know, and the skilled person would not know, but that did not matter as McDonald teaches that it does self-retract.  Overall, Mr Doosterlinck did not accept that the skilled person would find it all very confusing; he would understand that the hose would be actuated by a pressure in the range used in garden hoses.  I accept Mr Doosterlinck’s evidence.  I am not sure I have quite understood the technical point Mr Hinchliffe was here making: I would have thought that if an elastomeric material expands under pressure like a balloon, it would be likely to deflate when the pressure is removed, and that this is not dependent on how much or how little pressure is needed to expand it.  Be that as it may, the relevant question is whether the lack of detail on this point in McDonald would be a factor causing the skilled person to put McDonald aside as too confusing.

That is not the correct approach to a paper proposal such as McDonald, although it might be different if the skilled person had access to a working machine.  Mr Hurst made this point when he was cross-examined about McDonald.  It was put to him that, despite the fact that flexible elastomers had not been used for garden hoses before, he would know he could use them because McDonald told him that they can be used.

But the inner tube of McDonald, when self-retracting, is required to do work, because it is surrounded by (and pulling the weight of) the outer sheath and must cause it to move to a “gathered or shirred condition”.  Thirdly, the judge appears to dismiss Mr Hurst’s problem as irrelevant because the skilled person would bypass it and realise that the hose would be actuated by the (potentially) higher pressure in a garden hose.  But why would the skilled person start to contemplate the application of McDonald’s untested idea to a different application if unpersuaded that it would work for its own purpose?  Moreover, there is no explanation as to how the problem which troubled Mr Hurst would be any less real with a heavy garden hose, which is subject to different technical demands.  Mr Doosterlinck’s answer that higher pressure would expand the hose is nothing to the point.   </p>

There is all the difference, however, between transposing a hose structure shown to have worked well in the different field, and transposing a mere paper proposal from that field.

I think he was right to do so because space saving has clearly, at least historically, been a consideration in the design of a garden hose.  The space saving supposed to be achievable on a flight deck is mentioned by McDonald, and is also mentioned as an advantage of the invention in the patents in suit. On this appeal Mr Hinchliffe puts the matter slightly differently. He says the judge correctly recognised that garden water hose designers are not operating under the same severe space constraints as on a flight deck.  He says the judge was wrong to focus on this issue which the skilled person would not do without the benefit of hindsight.  He attacks the judge’s conclusion at [178] that the skilled person would see the space saving advantages of McDonald as potentially applicable more widely. </p>

The skilled person may be more interested in a prior art document if it deals with a problem which he is facing (see <span style="font-style:italic">Inhale</span> above).   By 2011, however, as the judge found, at least two types of common general knowledge garden hose assembly solved this problem: the reel and the corkscrew hose.  The skilled person would not be predisposed to take forward a proposal for a radically new design, therefore, merely because it claimed to be space saving.  That is quite apart from the point I have already made that the skilled person would not accept as practically established that the retraction feature (a prerequisite for space saving) would work.  What makes Mr Berardi’s invention a leap forward in the art is that it delivers three advantages in combination: space saving, lightness and no kinking.  The skilled person presented with McDonald, by contrast, is not presented with anything of which he is in real need.

But I do not think the present case is quite like that.  In Dyson the skilled person would be aware in a general sense of cyclone technology but would fail to make the connection with vacuum cleaners; here a hose designer would not have seen any hose, whether a garden hose or any other, that was anything like the hose in McDonald and would therefore have immediately appreciated that McDonald was showing him an entirely new type of hose.

Although the judge found that the skilled person was used to adapting a hose found useful in one application to another application, this is obviously not something which had happened in garden hoses, at least for a very long time.  It was at least material to ask the question why this was, rather than to dismiss it as irrelevant.  The idea that that the notional, unimaginative skilled person with an interest in this industry would seize on an untested proposal from a “very particular and very distant field” has the air of unreality when no ideas (even practical ones) appear to have been so transposed for so long.   </p>
