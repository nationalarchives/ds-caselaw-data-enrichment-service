Applications for leave to bring such an application are frequently made but rarely successful. In this case, however, for reasons that will emerge below, the mother was granted leave to apply by consent so that her substantive application for revocation continued to a fully-contested hearing. This is a very unusual event – so unusual, in fact, that neither counsel nor I have been able to discover any previous reported case in which a substantive revocation application has been considered by the court. </p>

On 12 April 2018, the local authority started proceedings under s.31 of the Children Act 1989. At that point, S was aged four and  L 18 months. The mother was then in the early stages of a further pregnancy. Following T’s birth in October 2018, the local authority started further proceedings in respect of him.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final hearing of the care proceedings took place in November 2018 before Recorder Davies. She concluded that the threshold criteria under s.31 were satisfied on the basis of a series of findings of fact including (a) that the children had been exposed to a number of physical assaults and numerous verbal altercations between parents and family members; (b) that both parents had a history of domestic violence as victims and perpetrators; (c) that the children continued to be at risk of exposure to domestic violence because the parents, who had separated during the proceedings, had recently resumed their relationship; (d) that the mother had been observed by professionals handling the children roughly, swearing and shouting in their faces; (e) that home conditions were reported to be poor and dirty on a number of occasions; (f) that both parents had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and (g) that the engagement of both parents had been inconsistent and superficial and as a result they had struggled to meet the children’s basic care or provide routine, stability or consistency. At the conclusion of the hearing, the recorder made care and placement orders in respect of all three children. Following the hearing, the children were placed together in a shortterm bridging foster placement while the local authority embarked upon the search for an adoptive placement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Shortly after the conclusion of the proceedings, the mother, who had by that point separated permanently from the father, started a new relationship with another man, JA. All parties to the present proceedings agree, and the judge found, that thereafter she underwent a remarkable transformation in her life. Although there were some reports of difficulties between the couple, the relationship has prospered and the mother’s lifestyle has settled down. JA has three children by a previous relationship. After the breakdown of that relationship, the children remained with their mother but following concerns about their care they were made the subject of child protection plans. Over the past 18 months, however, the children have spent significant periods of time with JA and the appellant mother, including one period lasting eight weeks. They are now living with their mother and staying overnight twice a week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, with JA and the appellant.  </p>

A few weeks later in June 2019, final contact visits took place between the mother and the children. Thereafter, contact has been confined to letterbox contact only. On 4 July 2019, prospective adopters for all three children were approved by the adoption panel and on 4 September 2019, the children were formally “matched” with those adopters. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The hearing of the mother’s application for leave to apply to revoke the placement orders was adjourned on several occasions, in part because of difficulties over public funding but also because the local authority proposed that the hearing should include a further fact-finding element arising out of concerns relating to the mother’s behaviour and relationship with JA. In November 2019, the mother disclosed she was expecting her fourth child of whom JA was the father. As a result, the local authority started a further investigation to determine whether proceedings should be started in respect of the new baby immediately after birth. In the event, however, the pre-birth assessment filed by the local authority on 11 February 2020 reported positive change in the mother’s life, as a result of which the local authority concluded that the new baby should remain in her care. Thereafter, after negotiations between the parties, the issues of fact which the local authority and guardian wished to be determined by the court were reduced. Furthermore, in the light of the positive pre-birth assessment, the guardian reversed her position on the mother’s application and supported the grant of leave to apply to revoke the placement order, albeit on the basis that she reserved her position in relation to the substantive application. Subsequently, the local authority also conceded that leave should be granted. On 13 February 2020, the court approved an agreed order granting the mother leave to apply to revoke the order and authorising an assessment of the mother’s application by an independent social worker. </p>

Unfortunately, I am not convinced there is any realistic level of support which would guarantee the safety and security of the children moving to live with their mother, at this juncture. S’s emotional needs present serious risk of her regressing, enduring further trauma through being reminded of her adverse experiences, confusion and placement breakdown. Furthermore, there is no realistic level of consistent support from the same caregiver, or any person who is familiar with all children, which would alleviate pressures on [the mother] who will be expected to meet the needs of four to seven children at any one time – a very demanding and pressurised task, one which is untested.”   </p>

Her application was supported by JA and the children’s father, but opposed by the local authority and guardian. On 25 September, HHJ Sharpe handed down judgment dismissing the mother’s application. On 14 October, the mother’s lawyers submitted a request for clarification of the judgment, to which the judge responded the following day. On that day, the mother filed an application for permission to appeal, which was refused by the judge. </p>

Applications for leave to apply to revoke a placement order are not infrequently made, but rarely succeed, no doubt because in most cases the child will be placed for adoption within a few months of the placement order being made and it will be very difficult for a birth parent in such a short period of time to demonstrate sufficient change of circumstances to open the door to revocation. As a result, substantive applications for revocation of a placement order rarely come before the court and, as stated above, counsel have been unable to find any reported case in which such an application has been determined. It follows that there is no case law providing guidance on how a court should approach an application to revoke a placement order once leave has been granted. </p>

In mounting this critique of the linear model, I am alive to the fact that, of course, a judgment is, by its very nature, a linear structure; in common with every other linear structure, it has a beginning, a middle and an end. My focus is not upon the structure of a judge's judgment but upon that part of the judgment, indeed that part of the judicial analysis before the written or spoken judgment is in fact compiled, where the choice between options actually takes place. What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options.” </p>

Although L had some recollection of her mother, the judge concluded there was nothing to indicate that she would have difficulty forming new attachments.

The judge noted that S retained an awareness of the domestic violence between her parents and was visibly unhappy when voices were raised. He concluded that, notwithstanding the significant progress made by S and L since they were removed from their parents’ care, the fact that S continued to display unease in such circumstances indicated the depth of the damage she had sustained over an extended period of time. </p>

It would almost certainly remove any prospect of a successful transition through to a permanent stable future for her. Finally, it would probably require separate consideration of the outcomes for the children with the likelihood that adoptive placements could be secured for only the younger two as they could still move on but S would be unable to form such permanent attachments to entirely new parents. </p>

His assessment of the needs of the children, and the mother’s capacity to meet their needs, had been flawed and unjustifiably exaggerated and was not supported by the evidence. He did not have the benefit of any expert psychological assessment in respect of the children to provide insight as to any emotional harm they had suffered, how they may be affected during their minority as a result of such harm, and in respect of their ability to establish a healthy relationship with their mother. The independent social worker, whilst noting that the mother had provided excellent care to N, had concluded that she was nonetheless at the limit of her capacity, but in reaching that conclusion had been unable to describe any features of the mother’s functioning to support it. It was submitted that the independent social worker and the judge had ignored or underestimated the fact that the mother and the intervener regularly care for four children, with the approval of the local authority. Ms Fottrell observed that it was unusual for a court to find itself contemplating a case where a mother was found to be capable of caring for one of her children and three other children who are not hers but deemed to be incapable of providing care for her three of her own children.  </p>

In this context, it was argued that he failed to engage properly with the welfare checklist in s.1(4) of the 2002 Act, in particular with the factors identified in s.1(4)(f).

The fact that a prospective adoptive placement had been identified did not obviate the need to re-evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of adoption, including the risk of the adoption breaking down. Although at the end of paragraph 44 of the judgment he raised the question whether the adoptive placement could be a successful placement for S, he had failed to answer it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is important to consider the way in which the case was argued before the judge, in particular on behalf of the mother. There are a number of striking features in the mother’s position in the court below as set out in Ms Greenwood’s closing submissions. First, it is plain that the mother accepted that, at the date when the placement orders were made in November 2018, adoption had been the right and only option for the children. Secondly, it is equally plain that the mother continued to accept that, if the children could not be returned to her care, adoption would be the best option – certainly for L and T and, subject to the court’s further scrutiny, for S. This is a highly unusual position for a parent in the mother’s circumstances to take. Although it seems that in the course of her evidence the mother may have stated that she considered long-term fostering to be a better option than adoption, this is not how her case was put in closing submissions. Thirdly, it demonstrated that, in the event that the children were not returned to her care, the mother wished to give positive support to them in their adoptive placement. All these factors provide further evidence of the mother’s growing maturity, insight and ability to focus on the needs of her children – yet further evidence of the transformation in the mother’s life over the past two years. They also had the effect of narrowing the scope of the issues to be determined at the hearing. In the light of the way in which the case was argued on behalf the mother, it is to my mind unsurprising that the focus of the judge’s inquiry was whether rehabilitation of the children with the mother was a viable proposition. </p>

He set out in considerable detail the remarkable progress the mother had achieved since the placement orders were made, concluding with the striking observation that she had transformed herself from a failed parent into a good parent. I accept that he could have identified more explicitly the advantages in this case of placing the children in her care but I have no doubt that he had those advantages firmly in mind. </p>

In doing so, however, it seems to me that he was fairly reflecting the evidence before him. I do not consider this surprising, since it was manifestly the key issue in the case to which the evidence had been largely directed. The extensive and detailed report from the independent social worker provided ample evidence addressing the strengths and reservations about the mother’s current lifestyle, parenting ability and capacity to care for these three children. The independent social worker also looked in detail at the needs of the children, speaking to them personally and to their current carer. As a result she was able to develop a good understanding of their individual and collective needs. In addition to her evidence, the judge had extensive evidence from the social workers and the overarching report of the guardian from which he was entitled to draw his conclusions.  </p>

As a result, he concluded that there was “only one outcome” which will meet the needs of the children.

In paragraph 80, he recognised that there were “downsides” to an adoptive placement including the risk of placement breakdown and the substantial prospect of what he described as an “eruption”, meaning a crisis for S at some point in the future. But compared to his conclusion that it was nearly certain that a placement with the mother would not succeed and the potentially catastrophic consequences that would flow from a breakdown of such placement, he understandably concluded the risks and disadvantages of adoption were manifestly lower. </p>
