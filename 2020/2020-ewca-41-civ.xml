	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These three appeals concern babies whose mothers concealed their pregnancies and did not want the fathers and other relatives to know of the births.  Should the local authorities and the court notify the fathers or relatives before plans for the children’s future are made and put into effect?  In each case the plan may involve adoption and in two cases that is what the mother wants. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Respect is due to the position of any mother who goes through pregnancy without family support and then chooses to relinquish the child at birth in the belief that it is for the best.  Respect is also due to the position of the unsuspecting relatives.  Some may have been a fleeting presence in the mother’s life, but others may be more significant figures who have been kept in the dark and would be astonished to find that a baby (their child, sibling or grandchild) had been born and adopted without their knowledge, particularly if they were in a position to put themselves forward as carers.  Most of all, the notification decision has life-changing implications for the baby.  It may influence whether adoption happens at all and, even if it does, a sound adoption has its foundations in the integrity of the process by which it is achieved.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For social workers and courts these are not easy decisions.  They have to be made without delay, on incomplete information, and in the knowledge of the profound consequences for everyone concerned.  The law aims to distinguish those cases where a ‘fast-track’ adoption without notification of relatives is lawful from the majority of cases where the profound significance of the decision for the child demands that any realistic alternatives to adoption are given proper consideration.  But in the end each case is unique and the outcome must depend on the facts. </p>

The application was determined by HHJ Marston on 16 August.  He directed that the local authority was under no obligation to inform the father or wider family members of A’s birth, or to seek to assess them as prospective carers.  He declared that the lack of notice would not be regarded as a reason not to make an adoption order in due course.  The Guardian applied for permission to appeal on 24 September and permission was granted on 16 October.   </p>

Where there are care proceedings, the s.1 checklist in the CA 1989 includes a requirement for the court to have regard to the capacity of the child’s parents and of other relevant persons to meet the child’s needs.  In this context a parent includes a father without parental responsibility.  Where there are proceedings for a placement order or an adoption order, the parallel checklist in the ACA 2002 requires the court and the local authority as the adoption agency to have regard to the lifelong effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of the original family and becoming an adopted person, to the relationship the child has with relatives (defined in s.144 as grandparents, siblings, and uncles and aunts), to their ability and willingness to provide a secure environment and meet the child's needs, and to their wishes and feelings.  These provisions are given procedural effect by the FPR 2010 and the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005, which impose duties on the local authority as the adoption agency and upon the Children’s Guardian as the child’s litigation friend to obtain information about these matters.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the same time, the primary legislation specifically allows for consensual adoption, also known as ‘fast-track’ adoption.  Section 18 ACA 2002 permits placement for adoption either with parental consent under s.19 or following a placement order under s.21, while s.20 allows for advance parental consent to adoption itself.  In this context a parent means a parent having parental responsibility (s.52(6)), and Part 14 of the FPR 2010 likewise provides that a father without parental responsibility is not an automatic respondent to proceedings for a placement order or an adoption order.  The legislative framework thus provides an avenue for adoption with the consent of the mother alone.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is also a considerable body of regulation and guidance, described in the panoramic judgment of Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H </span>(see below) at [17]-[28] and [37].  I would for present purposes single out the Department for Education Statutory Guidance on Adoption for Local Authorities, Voluntary Adoption Agencies and Adoption Support Agencies (July 2013) which provides balanced guidance on the issue for those agencies at [2.38-2.47].  I am less sure about the equivalent passages in the Cafcass/ADCS Good Practice Guidance for Adoption Agencies and Cafcass: Children Relinquished for Adoption (undated), which at [3.9-3.15] places such heavy emphasis on the avoidance of delay as to discourage Part 19 applications in cases where they might be appropriate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Nonetheless, as Cobb J notes, the statutory material as a whole provides strong indicators of the importance of engagement of the wider family in the adoption process.  In the circumstances, any request for an adoption that excludes a father or close family members will naturally be carefully scrutinised by social workers and the court.  That instinct is reinforced by the established domestic and European case law that emphasises that non-consensual adoption can only be approved if, after consideration of the realistic options, nothing else will do.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Before leaving the statutory provisions, it is convenient to identify (without at this stage deciding) an issue that emerges from the domestic case law and was argued before us.  Section 1 of the CA 1989 is addressed to courts and s.1 of the ACA 2002 is addressed to courts and adoption agencies.  They contain the familiar core principles of welfare paramountcy, the prejudicial effect of delay, and the welfare checklists.  These core principles apply <span style="font-style:italic">when a court determines any question with respect to the upbringing of a child</span> (CA 1989) or <span style="font-style:italic">whenever a court or adoption agency is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child</span> (ACA 2002).  The question is whether these principles, and in particular the welfare paramountcy principle, have direct effect when a local authority or a court are deciding whether or not to notify a putative father or a relative of the existence of a child or of proceedings.<span style="font-style:italic">  </span>It is surprising that such an elementary question should remain open to argument, but a review of the cases shows that until relatively recently it was understood that the notification decision is not one to which these provisions directly apply, while later decisions appear to have assumed that they do.  </p>

A mother and father separated after a relationship lasting 3 years. The mother did not inform the father that she was pregnant, having decided to give the baby up for adoption.  From the age of 2 months, the child lived with a couple who were considered likely to be ideal adoptive parents. The father only became aware of the child's existence when he was served with the adoption proceedings at the direction of the court.  He was in a stable relationship, had a secure job, and wished to care for the child himself.  He refused to consent to adoption and sought a residence order.  It was accepted that he was an impeccable father, whose lack of contact with the child was through no fault of his own.  There was a conflict of expert evidence as to the appropriate outcome.  The judge decided that the father’s consent was being unreasonably withheld and that there should be an adoption order, that the father should be granted parental responsibility, and that there should be contact twice a year.  He trenchantly criticised the local authority for not informing the father about the proceedings.  His decision was upheld by this court.

Although he is undoubtedly committed to looking after S, it is a fact that has to be faced that he and his fiancée, again through no fault of their own, are untried as parents and would be faced with caring for a small boy who, on any basis, does not know them and would be deeply upset at the concept of being removed from the only family that he knows, however carefully such a move was planned.”   </p>

Although no statistics are available, many children must have been adopted over the years, outside their birth families, with no knowledge by, or investigation of, other members of the birth family. Adoption exists to serve many social needs. But high among them has been, historically, the desire or need of some mothers to be able to conceal from their own family and friends, the fact of the pregnancy and birth. So far as I know, it has not previously been suggested, nor judicially determined, that that confidentiality of the mother cannot be respected and maintained. If it is now to be eroded, there is, in my judgement, a real risk that more pregnant women would seek abortions or give birth secretly to the risk of both themselves and their babies… There is, in my judgment a strong social need, if it is lawful, to continue to enable some mothers, such as this mother, to make discreet, dignified and humane arrangements for the birth and subsequent adoption of their babies, without their families knowing anything about it, if the mother, for good reason, so wishes.”  </p>

I recognise the importance of supporting unmarried mothers who wish to place babies for adoption and do not wish their family and friends or the natural father to know of the birth of the child. It is highly desirable that babies not able to be brought up by the natural mother should be cared for by local authorities and placed for adoption within a framework of confidentiality so far as it can be maintained. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950, however, underpins the evolving culture in our adoption legislation of greater involvement of natural families in postadoption placements and knowledge of the natural father. It also underlines the existing English law on the right of all relevant parties to notice of litigation, including potential litigation, and the relevance of r 15(3) to the natural father not married to the mother… A considerable degree of confidentiality is clearly important but it ought not, in the majority of cases, deprive the father of his right to be informed and consulted about his child. In my view, social workers counselling mothers ought to warn them that, at some stage, the court will have to make a decision in adoption proceedings as to whether to add the father as a respondent to the proceedings. The father should, therefore, be told as soon as possible in order to reduce delay, and certainly before the child is placed with prospective adopters. If the mother refuses to disclose the identity of the father, her reasons must be carefully considered and, unless those reasons are cogent, it would be wise for the local authority to seek legal advice at an early stage. If necessary, the local authority should follow the prudent course adopted by LA2 of an application to the court for directions on whether to notify the father.” </p>

She approached the local authority in the late stages of her pregnancy, stating that she wanted nothing to do with the child and asking it to arrange an adoption.  It  took care proceedings and sought directions as to whether the husband should be notified of the child’s existence.  The judge found that the mother’s evidence was unreliable, including in relation to the rape, and concluded that the balance was decisively in favour of notifying the husband.  The mother’s appeal was dismissed.  Thorpe LJ held that on the findings the judge had made, the outcome was inevitable.  He stated at [3], [14] and [19] that: </p>

She had six other children, three of whom had previously been adopted.  The probable father of the baby and of four of the other children was serving a prison sentence for drugs and burglary offences. No member of the maternal or paternal family knew of the baby’s existence.  The mother did not agree to the father being told because she was afraid that he might respond violently and because either his family or her own might bring pressure on her to withdraw her consent to the child's adoption.  Directing that notice should be given to the father, Hedley J held that where family life was established, as it clearly was in a case in which the couple had parented other children together, there had to be very compelling reasons indeed before a parent would be shut out from notice of the existence of the child or proposals for the child's future welfare.  Those compelling reasons needed to find their expression in the welfare of the child as well as the welfare of the other parent.  Given the strength and number of the links between the parents there was a real prospect that the father would find out about the child in due course.  While the case was unusual, there was nothing exceptional to justify non-disclosure.  </p>

The discretion requires the identification and balancing up of all relevant factors.  While the mother’s right to confidentiality is important it is not absolute.  The presence or absence of family life is an important, though not a decisive feature and where it exists strong countervailing factors are required to justify withholding knowledge of the existence of the child and the proceedings.  The tenor of the authorities is that in most cases notification will be appropriate and the absence of notification will be the exception; but each case will in the end depend on its facts.  In each case, the welfare of the child was regarded as an important factor but, significantly, there is no suggestion that the exercise of the discretion is governed by the paramountcy principle.      </p>

The local authority brought care proceedings with a care plan for adoption.

In my judgment, for the reasons given below, when a decision requires to be made about the long-term care of a child, whom a mother wishes to be adopted, there is no duty to make enquiries which it is not in the interests of the child to make, and enquiries are not in the interests of the child simply because they will provide more information about the child's background: they must genuinely further the prospect of finding a long-term carer for the child without delay. This interpretation does not violate the right to family life. The objective of finding long-term care must be the focus of making any further enquiries and that means the court has to evaluate evidence about those prospects. That did not happen in this case. The judge consequently directed himself according to the wrong principle and his exercise of discretion must be set aside. This court must exercise the discretion afresh.” </p>

For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that she considered that the child’s welfare was to be the paramount or “overarching” consideration for the local authority.

But she submits that the circumstances in which this should not occur would be limited to cases such as those where the life of the child would be at risk. The guardian relies on the societal shift towards greater involvement of natural father in the upbringing of children. The guardian accepts that each case must turn on its facts, and that a balancing act has to be conducted in each case. But she rejects the mother's contention that the judge was plainly wrong. She submits that the effect of s 1(4) (c) and (f) is that there is now an <span style="font-style:italic">expectation</span> of disclosure and that the courts should require compelling reasons to prevent it taking place, certainly to a natural father and probably too to close members of the wider family. In my judgment, as I have already indicated, the overarching consideration is that of the interests of the child. In many cases disclosure will be in the interests of the child, but it cannot be assumed that it will always be so. Moreover, disclosure has to be directed to an end that furthers the making of the decisions which require to be made. That requirement was not met in the present case.” </p>

The logical consequence of my interpretation of s 1 is that exceptional situations can arise in which relatives, or even a father, of a child remain in ignorance about the child at the time of its adoption. But this result is consistent with other provisions of the 2002 Act. There are situations when the court does not require the consent of the father. For example, the consent of the father without parental responsibility is not required for a placement under ss 19 or 20, and, even if E were to be placed for adoption with her mother's consent but her father later obtained parental responsibility, he would be deemed to have consented to the placing of E for adoption (see above).” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in"><span style="font-style:italic">Re C v XYZ County Council </span>confirms that in a proper case adoption can take place without the notification of father or relatives.  There is no statutory obligation upon a local authority to make enquiries in every case, and the issue of notification is a matter of discretionary judgment in the light of all the facts of the case.  It was a strong case on its facts, there being no reason to doubt the mother's account that her relationship with the father had been a fleeting one, with the consequence that her wish for privacy was always likely to prevail.  It has been necessary to look in some detail at the court’s reasoning only because of its observations about welfare paramountcy.  There is no indication that the court heard argument on the question of whether a decision of this kind is, in the words of s.1(1), “a decision relating to the adoption of a child”, or about the effect of the definition of these words at s.1(7).  Nor, in my view, did the decision turn upon that issue – applying the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">ratio decidendi</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Youngsam) v Parole Board </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 229, [2019] 3 WLR 33 at [21], it was not seen by the court as a necessary step in reaching its conclusion.  Arden LJ uses the word ‘overarching’ interchangeably with ‘paramount’, and none of the members of the court in fact reasoned the outcome by an application of the paramountcy principle, whereby other considerations are trumped by child welfare.  Instead, the court performed a familiar balancing of rights and interests: see Arden LJ at [40-43], and the emphasis throughout the judgments on the need to consider all the facts of the individual case.  I therefore conclude that we are not bound by the observations in relation to the issue of welfare paramountcy but must reach our own conclusion about it. </p>

They had had an extremely short relationship which ended after the second occasion of sexual intercourse.  The father, who was unaware of the pregnancy and birth, had a history of antisocial and criminal behaviour.  The baby had been placed in foster care.  The mother was vulnerable and feared that her life, which she was trying to rebuild after the turmoil caused by the birth, would be irreparably harmed if the father and his family became aware of the child’s existence.  After surveying the available information, Cohen J authorised nondisclosure, applying the principles summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A </span>[2018].  To these he added: </p>

The combination of circumstances, none in themselves exceptional, may, when aggregated, satisfy the test. Secondly, in considering whether the test is met one needs to conduct a holistic exercise considering all the circumstances. This includes an assessment, imperfect though it will necessarily be, of what the paternal family is likely to be able to offer. Thirdly, the fact that the mother could, if she had known, have declined to name the father and thus avoid this problem with which she and the court are now faced is not a relevant factor, although its impact on the mother may be relevant.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">49.  In exercising that broad discretion, I would suggest that the following be borne in mind.  There will be cases (if, for instance, there is a history of domestic or family abuse) where it would be unsafe to the child or the parent for the wider family to be involved in the life of the child, or even made aware of the existence of the child.  There will be cases where cultural or religious considerations may materially impact on the issue of disclosure.  There will be further cases where the mental health or well-being of the parent or parents may be imperilled if disclosure were to be ordered, and this may weigh heavy in the evaluation.  But in exercising judgment – whether that be by the local authority, adoption agency or court – I am clear that the wider family should not simply be ignored on the say-so of a parent.  Generally, the ability and/or willingness of the wider family to provide the child with a secure environment in which to grow ( <span style="font-style:italic">section 1(4)(f)(ii) ACA 2002 </span>) should be carefully scrutinised, and the <span style="font-style:italic">option itself </span>should be “fully explored” (see [28]).  The approach taken by Sumner J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham </span>case more than a decade ago, to the effect that “cogent and compelling” grounds should exist before the court could endorse an arrangement for the despatch of public law proceedings while the wider family remained ignorant of the existence of the child (see [29] above), remains, in my judgment, sound.  This approach is in keeping with the key principles of the <span style="font-style:italic">CA 1989 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">ACA 2002 </span>that children are generally best looked after within their own family, save where that outcome is not consistent with their welfare, and that a care order on a plan for adoption is appropriate only where no other course is possible in the child’s interests (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A child) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S </span>).”  </p>

Although some aspects of the statutory material and the case law relate to one type of decisionmaker rather than another, and some to one type of family member rather than another, there is in my view no reason for any essential difference of approach.  On the contrary, there is great benefit in a consistency of approach to the very varied situations that arise.  The decision of a social worker within his or her domain is as important as that of the court within its domain.  Similarly, there is no automatic hierarchy as between, for example, a putative father and maternal grandparents.  In some cases a notification decision will naturally focus on one or the other, and in some it will focus on both.  The factors that govern the outcome will depend on the facts of the case, not on the identity of the relative or of the decision-maker.  Nor should the calculus depend upon whether the issue arises within proceedings under the CA 1989, the ACA 2002 or Part 19, or whether the right kind of proceedings have been brought.     </p>

There will be cases where, applying the principles summarised in this judgment, the local authority can be very clear that no application is required and planning for placement on the basis of the mother’s consent can proceed.  But in any case that is less clear-cut, an application should be issued so that problems concerning the lack of notification do not arise when adoption proceedings are later issued.  In relation to a putative father, that application will be under Part 19 unless issues of significant harm have made it necessary to issue proceedings for a care or placement order; I would suggest that an equivalent application under the inherent jurisdiction can be made where a local authority has doubts about notification of a close relative.    </p>

In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced.  In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable.  The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement.  Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure.  In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child’s existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.   </p>

He directed himself with reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Re A </span>[2018] and recited the competing arguments.  He considered the social worker’s assessment that the mother presented as anxious and scared about the father and wider family knowing about A.  He acknowledged that the available information came entirely from the mother, though via an experienced social worker, but said that “it seems to me that the Mother is entitled to be believed.”  He also noted the local authority's case that any attempts to contact family members against the mother's wishes could impose further delays on planning for A. </p>

My assessment is therefore that if further enquiries were made on the basis of the information we have at the moment it is highly unlikely that any candidate from within either family will come forward to look after A and that it is quite possible that it would have a deleterious effect both on the child's placement and on the Mother's mental health. Taking the mother's wishes, which carry significant weight, and the unlikelihood of there being a family placement on the information that is available as I analyse it, it seems to me that that significant weight attached to the mother's views is much greater than any weight that I attach to having regard to the wishes and feelings of the other relatives of this child.  Given also that it is a natural parent’s wish to relinquish a child it seems to me that there is much less interference with Article 8 rights here than there is in other situations for adoption except that adoption of any kind still represents a significant interference in family life and in the circumstances of a relinquished child I do not have to find that nothing else will do, see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J and AO (2016) EWHC.</span>  Mr Fuller [for the local authority]… raises two potential risks that I have to consider very carefully.  First of all the possibility of an unguarded remark by the mother leading to the existence of A becoming known by family members with a family member making a late, possibly too late, application.  Balanced against that the only way I can be sure of that not happening is if the family are told, something which would, according to the Mother be disastrous.  Secondly Mr Fuller mentions the fact that A himself might question the circumstances of the adoption and why there is nobody in his birth family who could care for him.  We know the answer to that because he was surrendered for adoption and the judge had ruled that no further enquiries were to be made.  </p>

He appears to have accepted that the father had Article 8 rights but he gave them little weight, and did not adequately balance up the competing factors.

Whether what a mother says needs to be checked out is a question of judgment.  The father and wider families do not have Article 8 family life rights based on mere biological kinship.  Meanwhile, A will likely have developed Article 8 rights with his carers.  The possibility of a family placement had to be balanced against the certainty of delay and rejection of the mother’s expressed wishes about what she believes to be best for her child.  Notifying the family could “open a can of worms”.  There is nothing to indicate that the judge was wrong in the decision he reached.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, although the judge directed himself on the law, his decision does not in my view identify sufficient reasons to justify the father being kept in the dark about the birth and adoption of A.  The reasons given for non-disclosure concerned the risk to the mother’s wellbeing and her account of the improbability of a suitable family placement.  As to the first, disclosure would be likely to be difficult for the mother, but there was no convincing evidence to support the judge’s conclusion that it might be “disastrous”.  The rejection of the possibility of a family placement was based on the mother’s account without there being any objective basis for believing that the father and the wider families were very likely to have nothing to offer.  Nor was any real weight given to the potential benefits to A of growing up in his birth family if that is a realistic possibility, or of his adoption having his father’s participation, and even his blessing, if it is not.  I would not accept the local authority’s characterisation of the process of notifying a father of the birth of his child as “opening a can of worms” where the characteristics of the father or wider family raise no particular cause for concern.  The judge was entitled to note the delay involved in notification, but as the child had already been placed with prospective adopters, little weight could attach to that aspect of the matter.  In summary, while the judge rightly gave significant emphasis to the mother’s point of view, he did not sufficiently balance it against the other important considerations bearing on A’s lifelong welfare and the position of family members, and his decision cannot therefore stand.   </p>

As to the balance to be struck, I bring forward my observations from the preceding paragraph.  While I would not myself attribute Article 8 rights to the father, he has an interest to be considered.  The mother’s account does not provide a strong objective basis for discounting him as a suitable carer without further investigation.  The difficulties that notification is likely to cause to the mother do not outweigh the considerations relating to the interests of the father and the child in the context of a plan for adoption.  This interference with the mother’s right to respect for her private life is necessary and the staged approach proposed by the Guardian is proportionate.

He was alert to the risk of violence, to cultural and religious considerations, and to the mother’s vulnerability.

But even without that additional information, it would not be open to us to depart from the judge’s conclusion, which was that in these complex circumstances B’s interests in a potential family placement outweigh those of her mother and that there was no strong reason to justify the prevention of normal enquiries.  For these reasons, I agreed that the appeal would be dismissed.  </p>

She viewed the mother's case at its highest and accepted that the rapes must have been grossly distressing to her.  She was similarly prepared to work on the basis that the father had played a minimal role in helping the mother care for the older siblings.  She found it extremely strange that he did not realise that the mother was pregnant even though he was present in the home on the day the baby was born.  Nevertheless, all things considered: </p>

Many may congratulate her for that, that the children do have a relationship in relation to his [other] children, and his stepchild, do have a male in their life in the form of their father and although Mother urges that there could be domestic violence, the real effect is that she asserts he has never physically assaulted her…  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On behalf of the mother, Mr Howe QC and Ms Wilce argued that the judge did not adequately evaluate the comparative risks and benefits of disclosure and nondisclosure.  She should have placed her favourable assessment of the mother at the forefront of her consideration and was wrong to find that there were not sufficiently strong countervailing factors in the circumstances of C’s conception and the mother’s wishes to justify the court taking the exceptional step of withholding notice of the proceedings from the father.  Instead, having identified the correct legal principles applicable to the application, she treated her finding that the father had family life as determinative of the application.  In support of this, they note that at a later hearing on 1 November the judge remarked that her decision had arisen from the fact that the father had human rights and that that was “an end of the matter”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The local authority, through Ms Heaton QC and Ms Stanistreet-Keen, acknowledged that it had been wrong to issue care proceedings rather than a Part 19 application.  As to the substance of the decision, it continued to support the mother’s position and invited this court to make the declaration refused below.  More weight should have been given to the circumstances of the conception and the likely impact on the mother, on C and on the other children.  The judge approached matters on the basis that adoption was the most likely outcome and she should therefore have accepted that the emotional and physical risks to the mother and the other children of disclosure far outweighed any advantages that may be gained.  She failed to address C’s welfare and did not carry out sufficient analysis by reference to the welfare checklist.  Informing the father and the wider family must be for the purposes of identifying a possible alternative carer and not just for the purposes of informing them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">For C’s Guardian, Ms Wood QC and Ms Anning opposed the appeal.  They accepted that the case is sensitive but maintained that it is in C’s interests for there to be the fullest possible exploration of the welfare outcomes that might be available in circumstances where the father is not only married to the mother, albeit now separated, but is also the father/stepfather of C’s siblings.  The finding that the father had rights under Articles 8 and 6 has not been challenged.  The decision is of importance not just for C’s minority but for the rest of her life.  This court should be slow to conclude that the judge, who correctly identified the law and who had the considerable advantage of hearing evidence from the mother, was wrong.  It is of note that the mother herself had considered telling the father about C as recently as June and that her main reason for relinquishing C was not because of how she was conceived but because of her concern at the father's reaction to the concealed pregnancy.  The judge balanced up all of these matters.  A fair reading of the judgment shows that she clearly did not treat the finding that the father had Convention rights as being conclusive.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">again I consider that the judge sufficiently explained a decision that she clearly found unpalatable.  The distressing circumstances of the conception and the impact of them on the mother, which the judge fully considered, had to be set alongside the fact that C’s father has parental responsibility for her and is the father/stepfather of her siblings.  To proceed without notifying him of the birth would be an extremely strong course to take and in my view the judge was right to resist the temptation to do so.  For these reasons, which echo the submissions of C’s Guardian, I agreed that the appeal would be dismissed. </p>
