It is part of what the local development plan calls the New Eastern Villages (“the NEV”) which are identified as a strategic allocation to deliver sustainable economic and housing growth, including the provision of about 8,000 homes, 40 hectares of employment land and associated retail, community, education and leisure uses. The application for planning permission on the development site was the first part of the NEV to be determined. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The application for planning permission was accompanied by an Illustrative Landscape Masterplan. That showed the application site lying to the immediate south of the A420. Within the western part of the site, a road ran southward from a new junction with the A420 and continued to the southern boundary. It was labelled “North-South access road”. Halfway down that road a roundabout was shown, from which another road, described on the plan as the “East-West spine road”, ran to the eastern boundary of the site. The portion of the North-South access road which ran from the A420 junction to the roundabout was described as a “dual carriageway” on the Masterplan. The southerly continuation of the North-South access road from the roundabout was labelled “North-South link to wider NEV” and described as a single carriageway. The annotations to each road were that they contained a “carriageway” and “footpaths/cycleways to both sides”, giving the respective widths (between 59 and 61 metres). </p>

An addendum to the Design and Access Statement stated that it had been amended “to show highways extending to the site boundaries”. The purpose of that amendment was to “show the connectivity of the site to surrounding land”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The application for outline planning permission was placed before Swindon’s planning committee. We do not have a minute of the meeting; but we do have a copy of the officer’s report that the committee considered. One of the points that the officer made in several paragraphs of the report was that the application site was part of a wider development proposal. It was to “integrate physically and functionally” with adjoining development. The NEV was to come forward as “a series of new interconnected villages.” Each scheme had to demonstrate how it fitted into the wider NEV. The proposal “must provide connections to future development within the [NEV] in the interests of enabling the comprehensive and sustainable development of the NEV as a whole”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One section of the report was headed “Infrastructure requirements”. Paragraph 63 said that the site was “a key gateway” to the NEV; and paragraph 64 referred to the need for proposals to meet the infrastructure needs to mitigate the impact of the development. Paragraph 65 said that the transport requirements arising from the scheme included “a combination of direct provision of infrastructure and financial contributions towards mitigation of direct impact.” But importantly, the legal context in which they were discussed in paragraph 64 was regulation 122 of the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 dealing with planning obligations rather than conditions. It is also of note that the heading to what became condition 37 included a reference to a “section 38 agreement”. </p>

Dedication may be express, or may be inferred from public use. Both dedication and acceptance are necessary at common law, although there is a rebuttable statutory presumption of dedication after 20 years use as of right by the public. Before 1835 liability to repair highways was that of the inhabitants of the parish unless it could be shown that responsibility had attached to an individual or a corporate body by reason of tenure, inclosure or prescription. The imposition on the inhabitants of the parish of what could, potentially, be an onerous obligation led to the requirement of the common law that the existence of a highway could only be established by proving both dedication by the owner and acceptance by the public. Acceptance by the public demonstrated that there was a public benefit that justified the public assumption of liability to repair. Although the Highways Act 1835 abolished the universal rule that any highway was repairable at the public expense, it did not do away with the twin requirements of dedication and acceptance. It introduced a second stage, namely adoption, before a highway became maintainable at the public expense. Since the Highways Act 1959, as regards liability to repair, highways fall into three main classes: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Harwood QC, for Swindon, argues that it is lawful for a planning condition (as opposed to a planning obligation) to require a developer to dedicate land as a highway. If and in so far as that allows a local authority to have the benefit of a highway without the payment of any compensation, he relies on the proposition that a public authority may lawfully use powers which do not involve the payment of compensation in preference to powers that do. That proposition is well supported by authority: <span style="font-style:italic">Westminster Bank Ltd v Minister of Housing and Local Government</span> [1971] AC 508; <span style="font-style:italic">Cusack v Harrow LBC</span> [2013] UKSC 40, [2013] 1 WLR 2022. It is to be noted, however, that <span style="font-style:italic">Westminster Bank</span> involved no more than a refusal of planning permission for development to protect future road widening; while <span style="font-style:italic">Cusack</span> involved a choice between two express statutory powers. In addition, Mr Harwood’s proposition simply begs the question: is it lawful for a condition attached to a planning permission to require the developer to dedicate part of his land as a highway without compensation? </p>

Nor do I find persuasive the argument that the test of lawfulness is necessarily the same for the imposition of a condition and the contents of a section 106 agreement. In the way that the law has developed, they are subject to different constraints and achieve different purposes. Moreover, planning obligations under section 106 can only arise with the developer’s consent. They cannot be imposed by the local planning authority. </p>

Dedication could not be inferred from public use, for the simple reason that until the roadways have been constructed at which point (on the judge’s interpretation) they become highways, there will have been no public use. Although he disclaimed any intention of implying terms into condition 39, Mr Harwood argues that the only way to give effect to the repeated use of the word “highway” in that condition (“highway purposes” and “fully functional highway”) is by requiring dedication of the roads as highways. In other words it is implicit in the use of the word “highway” that the roads have been dedicated to public use. In my judgment, that is implication, because it extrapolates a legal meaning which is not apparent in the words of the condition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, it was by no means clear to me which parts of the development were to be dedicated as highways. Take the “turning spaces” for example. Mr Harwood suggested that these might be lay-bys on the north-south link and the east-west spine roads. But, even if the expression “turning spaces” could be stretched to include a layby, given the width of those roads as shown on the Illustrative Landscape Masterplan, it is impossible to see where lay-bys or turning areas might be required. In addition, the condition requires only that each unit is served by a fully functional highway. As Nugee LJ pointed out in argument, it is perfectly possible to satisfy this requirement without dedicating both the whole of the north-south link road and the whole of the east-west spine road.  </p>

The drafter of the condition thus appears to distinguish between a “highway” and a “<span style="font-style:italic">public</span> highway”. The same distinction between the “highway” and the “public highway” also appears in condition 43. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Sixth, condition 38 (although headed “Foot/cycleways”) deals only with footways and footpaths. The condition says that they must be constructed to wearing course level “<span style="font-style:italic">between</span> the development and highway”. That suggests, at the very least, that the highway does not form part of the development. Mr Harwood said that this condition also required dedication of the footways and footpaths as public footways and footpaths. That submission depended entirely on the statutory definition of “footway” and “footpath” in the Highways Act 1980. But to my mind, that is a very oblique way of requiring a developer to dedicate land for perpetual public use. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Seventh, the power to impose conditions on the grant of planning permission should not be interpreted as derogating from the rights of the owner to exercise his property rights, in the absence of clear words. The right in issue in this case is the right to forbid access to the land to anyone who enters it without the owner’s permission. This is not a right which is dependent on the construction of roads. It is a right inherent in the ownership (or perhaps more accurately the possession) of land. If condition 39 means what Swindon says it means, the land owner will have lost that right so far as it extends to the access roads. Swindon argue that the right in issue is the right to charge for granting a licence to use the roads. That is, no doubt, part of the right (and the immediate occasion for the dispute). But whether or not any adjoining owner agrees to contribute to the repair of the roads, on Swindon’s interpretation any member of the public (whether a licensee or not) may use the roads; and the land owner is powerless to prevent them. </p>

For the reasons given by Lewison LJ at [77]-[86], I consider that the inspector’s interpretation of condition 39 was the correct one. If I was in doubt as to the correct construction, then I would agree with Lewison LJ that the validation principle confirmed the inspector’s interpretation. I would only add that it is clearly established that the validation principle applies to documents other than contracts. Thus it also applies to patents, which are public documents: see Terrell on the Law of Patents (19th ed) at paras 9-71 to 9-78. The validation principle is not the same as the formerly recognised rule of benevolent construction: see Terrell at paras 9-80 to 9-85.  </p>
