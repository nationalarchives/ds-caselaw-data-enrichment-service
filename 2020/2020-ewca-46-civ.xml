The appellant, her father, together with other members of the local community, have provided witness statements setting out the opposition to the reconfiguration.  The population encompassed within South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group is 152,000.  Life expectancy in the South Tyneside area is considerably beneath the national average, with levels of health and underlining risk factors being some of the worst in the country.  Levels of smoking, consumption of alcohol and obesity leading to cancer and heart disease are among the highest causes of death.  The appellant contends that local hospital services are particularly important to such a population.  The campaign group’s petition to retain consultant-led services at STDH received between 30,000 and 40,000 signatures.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2016 the respondents established the Path to Excellence Programme in order to review and plan the future of hospital services at STDH and SRH.  It aimed to address three care gaps outlined in the NHS Five-Year Forward View: health and wellbeing; care and quality; finance and efficiency.  The aim of the programme was to undertake a full review of hospital services at both hospitals.  However, due to the substantial pressures facing stroke, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatric emergency services it was decided that phase one of the programme would deal with those areas as a priority.  It is the respondents’ case that the programme had been clear from the outset: services could not be retained in their current form.  This was consistent with national strategies for change taking place across the NHS and was in response to particular issues faced by the two hospitals.   </p>

The respondents published an Issues Paper which identified the challenge facing local health services and the proposals for change.  It provided information as to the steps being taken at that stage.  The document was published on websites and was available to the public.  A series of engagement events were held relating to the content of the paper.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The identified purpose of the programme was to secure safe and sustainable NHS services in the future.  Identified problems included the recruitment of staff in key clinical specialities, the impact of a failure to recruit on patient clinical care, recognition of the financial challenges which the NHS faced and the fact that the best use of staff expertise and other resources was not being made.  In the first section of the Paper entitled “Why things cannot stay as they are” it was stated that the quality of care received by people in the area could vary.  It identified growing demands upon the NHS which resulted in financial pressure on local organisations at a level never before seen.  It acknowledged that the needs and expectations of the public were changing, that different and more complex care was required and that local health services needed to change in order to produce a more effective and efficient local health service.  Duplication of services and system pressures were identified as particular problems.  The gaps in the provision of care as highlighted in the National Five-Year Forward View Plans which include ensuring quality of care, seven day working, access targets, local sustainability, artificial mass concerns, workforce issues and the “financial picture” were identified. </p>

Efforts had been made to recruit and retain staff but these had not been successful “due largely to the fact that these roles are not an attractive option for prospective candidates”.  As was noted in the PCBC, recruitment to small teams such as that at STDH can be a problem as, for example, consultants often wish to work in large teams which offer them a number of opportunities to participate in wide-ranging aspects of their chosen discipline.  Small teams can lead to onerous and unstable on-call rotas, the relatively small number of patients treated at STDH can result in clinicians being unable to maintain and develop their clinical skills.  It was such considerations which led Dr Hambleton to conclude that “unfortunately, STDH remains an unattractive option for doctors, and there is no evidence that the visa cap has been a significant cause of recruitment problems or that the hospital is anticipating any significant changes as a result of the lifting of the Tier 2 cap”.   </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Day v Harris</span> [2014] Ch 211 CA, for instance a judge added a passage to the transcript which had not been included in his oral judgment.  The Court of Appeal described this as ‘unfortunate’ because the addition was made long after the trial and it added a finding of fact on a controversial issue.  The Court did not suggest that the Judge was disempowered from changing his oral judgment and there would have been no comparable objection to an alteration in the present case.  If, as in this case, the order of the Court consequent on the judgment has been sealed, the changes cannot usually alter that order.  Otherwise, though, it is a matter for the Judge's discretion as to what changes are appropriate.” </p>

The question is one of substance, not form.  Even judicial acts done in excess of jurisdiction are orders.  This is the rationale for section 9(2), which preserves the rule that courts of unlimited jurisdiction are not amenable to judicial review, because it is assumed that an appeal is available.  Mr Tomlinson was unable to give us any realistic examples of a judicial act that would not be amenable either to appeal or judicial review.  </p>

Whether or not a formal order was drawn up on that day, as it should have been, that was the ‘day’ on which the decision took effect under CPR, r 40.7(1) and the time for appealing ran from that date.  The judge was at liberty to alter the words of his judgment when correcting or perfecting the transcript; indeed, if the transcript was defective, he was obliged to do so.  The later release of the corrected transcript was not, however, the ‘day’ on which the decision was made.  The court’s final order dismissing the application for judicial review should have been issued to reflect the decision taken in December 2018 and not July 2019.
