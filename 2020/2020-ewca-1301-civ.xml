Officers will be guilty of misconduct if they use force which is not “necessary, proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances”. If officers hold an honest, but mistaken, belief as to the danger faced, a disciplinary panel will only find them to be guilty of misconduct if their mistaken belief was unreasonable in all the circumstances. Paragraph 4.4 of the Code (“paragraph 4.4”) merely explains that officers must, after force has been used, account for or justify its use based upon their honestly held belief at the time. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.00in">W80, the Commissioner, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (the “NPCC”) and the Divisional Court all took a different view. They regarded paragraph 4.4 as providing a clear pointer to the application of the criminal law test for self-defence. An officer would only be guilty of misconduct in the circumstances of this case if his belief that he was in imminent danger was not an honestly held one, or if he had used more than the minimum amount of force necessary. Once it was determined that the officer held an honest belief that he was in imminent danger, there could be no inquiry in misconduct proceedings as to whether that belief was a reasonable one to have held in all the circumstances. Thus, in this case, once the Director of Public Prosecutions (the “DPP”) had decided (as she did) not to prosecute W80, there was no possibility of misconduct proceedings being successful, because the applicable tests were the same. </p>

They planned to use a stolen Audi A6. The police mounted a large operation which involved two covert listening devices being planted in the car, specialist surveillance officers and eleven specialist firearms officers, including the claimant, in specialist vehicles. The intelligence provided to the specialist firearms officers was that the men in the car were in possession of firearms and intended to use them to free the prisoners from the van. This formed the basis of the threat assessment by the specialist firearms officers before and during the operation. </p>

At about 9am, when the prison van containing Eren and his co-defendant had left HMP Wormwood Scrubs the specialist firearms officers were instructed to intervene. At the time they approached the car the officers could not see inside as the windows were steamed up, so that they did not know how many men were in the car or what they were doing. In accordance with standard procedure, there were shouts of orders to those inside the car. [W80] opened the front passenger door. [Mr Baker] was sitting in the front passenger seat. [W80] pointed his firearm between the door and the side of the vehicle. His account was that despite instructions to put his hands on the dashboard, [Mr Baker’s] hands moved quickly up towards his chest where he was wearing a shoulder bag. [W80] said: “I believed at that time that this male was reaching for a firearm and I feared for the safety of my life and the lives of my colleagues. I discharged my weapon firing one shot”. There was no firearm in the bag, but an imitation firearm, a black uzi style machine gun, was found in the rear of the car. </p>

The Divisional Court specifically cited paragraph 1.34 of the Home Office Guidance issued in 2008 (prior to the existence of the College or the publication of the Code), which was not repeated in the HOG issued in 2014.

Key police witnesses should independently record what they honestly perceived, i.e. what they think that they saw, heard, and then did. The purpose of the personal initial account is to record the perceived threats and risks that led to the decision to use force, before this recollection can be affected or potentially altered”. The APAPP expressly links this advice to paragraph 4.4 of the Code by saying under the heading “Integrity” that: “[t]he Code of Ethics states that accountability, honesty, integrity and openness are key policing principles”. It then repeats paragraph 4.4 in full before warning that “[p]olice officers should ensure that all activity, including that which relates to the separation of key police witnesses and recording of accounts, is transparent and capable of withstanding scrutiny ...”. </p>

They are trained that the “criminal law test for self-defence focusing on their “honestly held belief” applies to their decision making”, and are not instructed that the civil law test for self-defence will apply for the purpose of misconduct proceedings. Mr Chesterman notes that the APAPP refers to the criminal law test under “Common Law; Self-defence: Reasonable force”, but makes no reference to the civil law test for self-defence applying for the purpose of misconduct hearings, “simply refer[ring] officers … to the relevant Standards of Professional Behaviour, including Use of Force”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Chesterman says that the “national understanding among armed officers, firearms commanders and tactical advisors” with whom he has regular dealings is that the criminal law test is applicable in misconduct proceedings following on from the discharge of a firearm which has or may have resulted in death or serious injury. He is concerned that applying the civil law test for self-defence would seriously affect an armed officer’s mindset when making a split-second decision: “If the starting point is that the officer honestly believes there to be an immediate threat to life, to import into the officer’s decision making a further requirement that their honestly held belief also has to be objectively reasonable would add a dangerous layer of complexity and hesitation … [which] … could seriously increase the risk to the public and officers”. </p>

Specifically, he believes that public confidence in armed policing operations would be undermined by police officers being more hesitant to discharge their firearms for fear that dismissal will follow an adverse determination, and by problems with recruitment and retention. </p>

The College submits that it is clear from the text of the Code, read in its statutory context, that it does not purport to lay down the test that should be applied in police misconduct proceedings when determining whether there has been a breach of the use of force standard. The College considers there to be a clear structure to paragraph 4 of the Code: paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 identify the police officers and other staff for whom the standard is likely to be relevant; paragraph 4.3 elaborates upon what level of force is envisaged by the standard, and paragraph 4.4 indicates what is expected of a police officer after the use of force. That is why the officer must account for their use of force based on their honest understanding of the situation at the time when the force was used (“justify it based upon your honestly held belief”). In this respect, paragraph 4.4 is consistent with the guidance given on the first standard of honesty and integrity and it is consistent with the guidance given in the APAPP.  </p>

CC of Sussex Police (Sherwood intervening)</span> [2008] 1 AC 962, Lord Scott of Foscote at [17]-[18] described the criminal and civil tests. He said at [17] that the presumption of innocence and the principle that no one should be punished for the consequences of an honest mistake explained why a person who honestly believed he was “in danger of an imminent deadly attack and responds violently in order to protect himself from that attack” should be able to make a plea of self-defence as an answer to a criminal charge. Nonetheless, the greater the unreasonableness of the belief the more unlikely it may be that the belief was honestly held.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

Conversely, it was said that public scrutiny and accountability demanded that a public misconduct hearing should decide whether, in a situation of this kind, an officer’s honest belief was reasonable. Both arguments are compelling, but somewhat miss the point. </p>

They are, as we have said, contained in schedule 2 of the 2012 Regulations.  The relevant statutory requirement is that “[p]olice officers only use force to the extent that it is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances”. That standard is elaborated upon and explained by the Code, but the Code cannot alter the standard itself. The question is not, as the respondent would have it, whether the standard, as explained by the Code, is more consistent with either the civil or the criminal test of self-defence. Those tests are, of course, important, but they do not dictate the proper meaning of the standard. </p>

There are a multitude of situations to which the standard applies, as paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the Code make clear. It applies to police officers, police staff, volunteers and contractors. It applies where force of any kind is used, for example in arresting citizens, restraining them and taking them into custody. It applies where lethal force is used, but not only in that situation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">Paragraph 4.3 of the Code makes clear, as is required in both the criminal and civil tests for self-defence, that only the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve the required result should be used. But even that indication does not in our judgment mean that paragraph 4.4 must be regarded as automatically pointing to the imposition of the criminal test for self-defence. Paragraph 4.4 is not well drafted, as Flaux LJ pointed out. It provides that an officer “will have to account for any use of force, in other words justify it based upon [their] honestly held belief at the time”. It is noteworthy that, as recorded in footnote 1 above, the previous draft of paragraph 4.4 of the Code, upon which the College consulted, provided that “[i]t will be for you to justify your use of force, and show that it was proportionate, lawful, necessary and reasonable. In assessing your use of force, the circumstances facing you at the time will be taken into account”. The College’s Briefing Note suggested that the reason for the change was to provide “[c]learer structure and wording”. There was no suggestion that it was intended to import the first part of the criminal test for self-defence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">In addition, other paragraphs of the Code do clearly impose additional tests or requirements as Mr Jason Beer QC, leading counsel for the Commissioner, pointed out.  Paragraph 5.3 overlays the standard that officers “only give and carry out lawful orders and instructions”, with the clear indication that it is not misconduct to refuse to follow an order that is reasonably believed to be unlawful. Paragraph 6.4 adds to the standard that officers are “diligent in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities” a test as to whether membership of an association creates a conflict of interest and duty. Likewise, paragraph 7.5 makes clear that the generally expressed confidentiality standard requires officers to ensure that nothing they publish online can reasonably be perceived by the public as discriminatory. It would have been easy for the Code to say expressly that it would not be misconduct for proportionate force to be used where the officer honestly believed that he was threatened, even if that belief was unreasonable. It did not do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">As the College submitted, paragraph 4.4 is consistent with the APAPP and, properly understood in its context, “gives guidance to a police officer as to how he or she will be expected to explain his or her behaviour if he or she has used force: his or her explanation must be honest and it must be based on what he or she knew at the time”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">We cannot, therefore, agree with Flaux LJ when he said at [66] that “the July 2014 Home Office Guidance and the Code of Ethics pose insuperable obstacles to the Court ruling that the question whether the Use of Force Standard of Professional Behaviour has been breached is to be determined by reference to the civil law objective test”. Paragraph 4.4 does not address the question of the criminal law subjective test versus the civil law objective test for self-defence. It simply gives guidance as to how the officer is to seek to justify his use of force, namely by reference to his honestly held belief at the time. That belief will then be judged by the disciplinary panel according to whether the force used was “necessary, proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">We agree with Flaux LJ when he said at [67] that the justification provided by officers under paragraph 4.4 is so as to demonstrate (if they can) that there has not been a breach of the applicable standard. It does not, however, follow that paragraph 4.4 is making a reference to the first limb of the criminal law test. Paragraph 4.4 is referring to the accounts that officers must give of their use of force, which must be based on their “honestly held belief at the time”. Those words cannot, as we have said, override the plain words of the standard itself that provide that officers “only use force to the extent that it is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.00in">There was much time spent on the other objective parts of a conduct investigation. It was said that, in determining whether an officer’s belief was indeed honestly held, the reasonableness of that belief will be relevant. It was only because in this case the investigator determined that the belief was indeed   honestly held that the objective element was removed. All that is true, but it does not demonstrate that there can be no misconduct wherever an officer uses proportionate force based on an honest belief that he was in danger. If the officer makes an honest mistake, as Ms Davidson put the case, the disciplinary panel must still determine whether the use of force was, in the words of the standard “reasonable in all the circumstances”. In many cases, of course, an honest mistake is also likely to be found to have been reasonable in all the circumstances, but there will be some cases where it will not. It is not our task to speculate on the numerous different situations that might occur.  </p>

The respondent’s submissions seek to introduce a technical meaning which is not apparent on the face of paragraph 4 of the Code.  Neither the 2012 Regulations, the HOG nor the Code make express reference to the criminal test for selfdefence. It would, we think, be quite inappropriate to read such a test into a simply drafted and readily comprehensible standard, without clear words. The public would reasonably expect the standards of conduct to apply without any gloss. The respondent’s submissions would prevent public scrutiny of the serious situation that </p>

The IOPC was justified in concluding that it was open to a reasonable panel at a misconduct hearing to make a finding of misconduct if W80’s honest, but mistaken, belief that his life was threatened was found to be unreasonable. That conclusion was soundly based in law on the proper and plain meaning of the 2012 Regulations and the Code. The assessment of the disciplinary panel in misconduct or gross misconduct proceedings is not to be made by reference to any imported test relating to self-defence.  </p>
