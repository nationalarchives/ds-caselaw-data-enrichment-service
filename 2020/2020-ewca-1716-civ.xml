	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The serious nature of the some of the injuries will be understood when I say that on 1 October 2014, in the Crown Court at Southwark, Spence (who already had 37 previous convictions for 62 offences) pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated burglary and to three offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to s. 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Thereafter, on 21 October 2014, in the same Crown Court, after a trial before HH Judge Leonard QC and a jury, he was convicted of three offences of attempted murder and of a further offence of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary. He was sentenced by the trial judge to three concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, with a specified minimum custodial term of 18 years. No separate penalty was imposed for the other offences.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Appellants are all members of the same family and are citizens of the United Arab Emirates; they were guests at the hotel at the relevant time. The most serious injuries were suffered by the first three Appellants, who (with the parties’ agreement) were referred to by the judge in his judgment as Ohoud, Khaloud and Fatima. With no discourtesy intended, I propose to take the same course. Those three Appellants, and Khaloud’s three children (aged 12, 10 and 7) were accommodated in rooms 7007 and 7008 on the seventh floor of the hotel; these were rooms with an inter-connecting door between them. CCTV footage showed Spence entering the hotel at 0113 hours on that Sunday morning, when Ohoud, Khaloud, Fatima and the three children were asleep in their rooms. Having crossed the hotel lobby, where he passed unchallenged at one point within about 8 metres of the hotel’s lobby officer, Mr. Wasif Zafar, Spence took the lift to the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> floor. He entered Room 7008 and began to steal money, jewellery and other items from there and from Room 7007. (The door to Room 7008 had been deliberately left unlocked and open so that another family member could return a hair-dryer that had been borrowed.) Khaloud awoke and Spence attacked her, hitting her on the head with a hammer. He also attacked Ohoud and Fatima in the same way. Spence then left the hotel carrying a suitcase and returned to his accomplice, who later used credit cards stolen from the Appellants to obtain £5,000 in cash. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The trial involved a lengthy review of very many facets of the security arrangements at the hotel and the judge had to consider what was, in effect, a full-frontal attack by the Appellants upon the adequacy of the entirety of those arrangements as a whole. In paras. 199 to 228 of his judgment, the judge summarised some 30 heads of criticism as he put it “by broad reference to the way that they were pleaded in the Particulars of Claim and Defence” and his conclusions on them. He said that he recognised that once the evidence had been heard the submissions concentrated on some issues more than others. The judge found that the Respondent was not in breach of duty. While there was overall criticism of many aspects of the security system at the hotel, two specific areas of argument were directed to the questions of access to the guest lifts, which at that time could be operated without a key card, and to the role of Mr Zafar in challenging (or failing to challenge) those entering the hotel. It was those features that allowed Spence access to the lifts and thence to the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> floor where the Appellants’ rooms were. In addition, of course, Spence actually gained access to rooms 7007 and 7008 because the door to one of those rooms had been deliberately left unlocked, open and readily accessible.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In general, the judge found the hotel’s overall security systems to be adequate. He did not find there was any breach of duty arising from the failure to challenge Spence when he entered the hotel or in the hotel not having in place key card access to the lifts. His findings on these points can be seen principally from paras. 229, 232 and 233 of the judgment, as follows:  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in">“229. I have considered carefully all of the lay and expert evidence about the breaches of duty. In my judgment the evidence as a whole showed a hotel in which security was taken seriously by Mr Loughrey and the security officers and the hotel did take reasonable care to protect the Claimants against the injuries caused by Mr Spence. The hotel did not need to monitor continuously CCTV cameras. This is because there is nothing to suggest that this is an activity carried out by any other hotel proprietor given the low likelihood of any attack occurring. For similar reasons in my judgment to act reasonably the hotel did not need to install CCTV cameras in the lift or on the fire escape staircases. The hotel did not need to have an alarm system to alert security staff to open guest doors. Any such system would generate alarms when there was cleaning of the rooms, or guests were taking too long leaving the room. There was nothing to suggest that this should be used by any reasonable hotel proprietor. The duty was to take reasonable care to prevent the attacks, it was not an absolute duty to prevent an attack. </p>

This is because there was sufficient security provided by the lobby officer walking around the lobby and looking at guests, even though this activity was not apparent on all occasions as appears from Ms Coleman's evidence. In my judgment to act reasonably the hotel was not required to insist that the lobby officer greet every single guest after 11 pm. This was because the lobby officer was looking after the whole of the lobby and looking at some, but not all guests when they entered. For similar reasons there was no duty to put a key card reader and insist that every guest show their key card, even though this occurred later at a time of heightened terrorist alert.  </p>

The evidence showed that such systems were liable to being overridden by tailgating and other guests pressing buttons allowing access to others. Even after its installation it was noted that the lobby security officer was the primary means of providing security. My conclusion on these matters is part supported by the approach taken to security by other 4 star London hotels where all but one did not have key card lift access readers.” </p>

Mr<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Loughrey said that by moving around the lobby security officer acted as a deterrent. Although a possible reading of the duties of the lobby security officer was to greet and introduce himself to every person entering the hotel (because of the words " <span style="color:#313134">... </span>introduce to all persons entering hotel<span style="color:#313134">"</span>) Mr Loughrey said that was not the proper interpretation of the duties of the lobby officer.

That is the requirement specified in para. 3(a) of the grounds of appeal that the duty required that he met and greeted “every guest after 11 p.m. where possible, alternatively where reasonably practicable”. It is argued that, in accordance with that requirement Mr Zafar should have accosted Spence when he entered the hotel, because that was “(eminently) possible/reasonably practicable.” Given the focussed manner in which that ground of appeal is advanced, the crucial question now is whether the Respondent was in breach of duty when Mr Zafar failed to accost this one individual on the particular occasion in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This has to be seen, however, in the light of the case presented for the Appellants at the trial. I have already summarised above the nature of the duties alleged in respect of the lobby officer, as pleaded in sub-paras. 23(bb) and (cc) of the Particulars of Claim, namely that the officer should have adopted a visible fixed position between the main entrance and the lifts, and that the hotel should have ensured that he hosted and greeted (i.e. if necessary, challenged) every “guest” entering and using the guest lifts. As can be seen, that absolute duty was not accepted by the defendant. I consider the judge correctly held at para. 239 of the judgment, (as was common ground on the pleadings) the duty on the hotel was to take reasonable care to prevent attacks such as this; it was not (and was not alleged to be) an absolute duty to prevent an attack. The judge also found that, while the consequences of an intrusion of this character might be very serious, the evidence showed that the likelihood of such an attack was extremely low (para. 195); that finding is not challenged. Having reviewed the evidence overall, the judge was clearly entitled to reach the view that the ambit of the duties actually imposed on the lobby officer by the Respondent was reasonable. Those duties rendered impossible the absolute duty, alleged on behalf of the Appellants, to engage every person entering the hotel at this time.  </p>

That issue was not explored to any significant extent in the evidence of Mr Zafar at the trial, as appears from the only extract from his cross-examination before the judge to which we were directed. We were shown the few pages of that evidence dealing with the moment of Spence’s entry. For example, Mr Zafar was not asked why Spence was not hailed by him from across the lobby or why he did not advance deliberately towards Spence in order the verify his purposes. It was not suggested to him, for example, that he should have followed Spence to the lifts to check him at that point.  It was not explored with him (or other witnesses) whether to do so would have been consistent with the ambience of a hotel such as this, in the absence of a specific cause for suspicion. Such questions would have been highly material to the more qualified duty for which the Appellants now contend on the appeal. </p>

There was apparently nothing more about Mr Zafar’s conduct, or about lack of reaction to Spence’s entry, in the moments between that entry and his taking one of the lifts. That was, of course, consistent with the case being advanced: namely that <span style="font-style:italic">every</span> person had to be engaged directly and Mr Zafar had clearly not done that. There was no significant challenge to him as to the possibility or practicality of making direct contact with Spence, whatever Mr Zafar’s conduct may have been towards others entering in that period. That was the evidence that the judge had on which to assess whether Mr Zafar (and with him the Respondent) was responsible for the tragedy that befell the Appellants at the hands of Spence. </p>

It is because specific findings of fact, even by the most meticulous judge, are inherently an incomplete statement of the impression which was made upon him by the primary evidence. His expressed findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification and nuance … of which time and language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the judge’s overall evaluation. … Where the application of a legal standard <span style="font-style:italic">such as negligence</span> or obviousness involves no question of principle but is simply a matter of degree, an appellate court should be very cautious in differing from the judge’s evaluation.” (Italics added) </p>

The judge did that and he reached a conclusion, on this one aspect of the many breaches of duty alleged, in light of those factors. There was no specific challenge at all as to whether it was possible or reasonably practicable for Mr Zafar, from where he was at the crucial moment, to have directed a specific challenge to Spence as he entered the hotel. The nature of the duty alleged has now become shaded from the absolute duty that was being assessed at the trial. That shaded duty was not the one that the judge was called upon to assess. I do not see that his final conclusion that (on the basis of the primary facts found by him) there was not a breach of the duty alleged, can be faulted. </p>
