In a judgment dated 5 June 2019 (“the Costs Judgment”) ([2019] EWHC 1401 (Ch), [2019] 1 WLR 5737), Morgan J (“the Judge”) concluded that costs orders should be made against the appellant, Ms Susan Glover, who had acted as litigation friend to her children Tom and Freya Barker (“Tom” and “Freya”).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the 1990s, Mr Barker set up a business which developed into a group of companies of which Team 121 Holdings Limited (“Team 121”) was the parent. By 1998, Mr Barker wished to sell his shares and sought tax planning advice from Baxendale Walker Solicitors, of which a Mr Paul Baxendale-Walker was the principal partner. On the basis of advice from Baxendale Walker Solicitors, Team 121 established an employee benefit trust (“the Trust”) whose beneficiaries were given as present, past and future employees of the group and their families but not “Excluded Persons”, the definition of which term was based on section 28(4) of the Inheritance Act 1984 (“the IHTA”). On 15 October 1998, Mr Barker executed a deed of gift (“the Deed of Gift”) declaring that he held his shares in Team 121 on trust for the Trust, subject, however, to a clause providing for the shares to be held on trust for him if HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) determined that the Trust did not satisfy the conditions laid down in section 28 of the IHTA and section 239 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (“the TCGA”). On 23 March 1999, the then trustee of the Trust declared a subtrust (“the Sub-Trust”) for “the widow, children and remoter descendants and the mother and sisters of Iain Paul Barker who shall be living after his death”, collectively termed the “Principal Beneficiaries”. In June 1999, the shares in Team 121 which Mr Barker had formerly held were sold and their proceeds were credited to the Sub-Trust. </p>

HMRC maintained that the requirements of section 28(4) of the IHTA were not met because the Trust did not exclude Mr Barker’s family members as beneficiaries after his death. Mr Barker appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, but in 2013 Mr Barker entered into a settlement under which he paid HMRC about £11.3 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“33.  In his Particulars of Claim in these proceedings, Mr Barker put forward two contentions. The first contention relied upon the condition expressed in the Deed of Gift. The Particulars of Claim explained Mr Barker’s case as to how that condition was to be construed. In effect, he contended that the condition required the gift to be an exempt transfer for inheritance tax purposes pursuant to IHTA 1984, section 28 and a disposal which would be treated for capital gains tax purposes as having been made for a consideration which involved neither a gain nor a loss pursuant to TCGA 1992, section 239. The pleading then contended that this condition was not satisfied at the date of the Deed of Gift because the terms of the EBT [i.e. the Trust] did not satisfy IHTA section 28(4). In this respect, the pleading stated that the trust did allow benefits to be conferred on persons connected with Mr Barker and the pleading also relied upon the powers contained in clause 11 of and paragraph 1.2.18 of schedule 1 to the Deed. The pleaded result of the foregoing was said to be that the gift contemplated by the Deed of Gift failed so that the proceeds of sale of the Shares were held by Confiànce on a bare trust for Mr Barker.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">34.  The second contention put forward in the Particulars of Claim in the trust proceedings was that the Deed of Gift had been made by Mr Barker in the mistaken belief that members of his family would be capable of benefitting from the trusts of the EBT after his death. He sought an order from the court setting aside the Deed of Gift on the ground of mistake.” </p>

It was proposed that £1 million should be settled on discretionary trusts for the benefit of Euan and “Principal Beneficiaries” of the Sub-Trust who were not parties to the proceedings, that £500,000 should be settled for the benefit of employee beneficiaries of the Trust and that Mr Barker should be entitled to the balance of the funds held by the Trust and Sub-Trust.

What happened in this case resulted in Ms Meek as the litigation friend for Euan, as a representative defendant, and leading and junior counsel advising Ms Meek, deliberately not informing Tom and Freya and Ms Glover of a proposed compromise so as to prevent them expressing their views upon that compromise. The decision not to inform Tom and Freya and Ms Glover was because it was foreseen that Ms Glover would be likely to raise objections to the compromise and would not agree to it. Ms Meek and counsel may or may not have thought that Ms Glover might be influenced by collateral considerations and might not act in the best interests of Tom and Freya. On the material before me, Ms Meek and counsel appear to have readily acquiesced in Mr Barker’s wishes and opinions on the matter; they do not appear to have thought it necessary to form their own opinion on that matter. It might have been open to Ms Meek and to counsel to come to a reasoned and well-informed conclusion that it was not in the best interests of Tom and Freya for Ms Glover to be told of the proceedings but simply acquiescing in Mr Barker’s wishes did not amount to reaching a reasoned and well-informed conclusion on the matter. </p>

The court might also have welcomed relevant adversarial argument so that the court would have before it the full range of relevant considerations.

Mr Barker had been unsuccessful at first instance (see [2016] EWHC 664 (Ch)), but on 8 December 2017 the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal, concluding that a reasonably competent solicitor would have warned Mr Barker that there was a significant risk that the employee benefit trust (or “EBT”) arrangement into which he was to enter would not work because section 28(4) of the IHTA was to be construed in the manner for which HMRC later contended in the First-tier Tribunal proceedings. The Court further said that that construction of section 28(4) was probably correct: in other words, that a transfer of shares to an EBT was probably excluded from being an exempt transfer within section 28(4) if the trust permitted any of the settled property to be applied for the benefit of a person who, at the date of the transfer, fell within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 28(4), regardless of whether that person would still fall within the relevant paragraph at the time when the settled property came to be applied for his benefit. </p>

	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“Mr Seitler QC seeks a direction pursuant to rule 19.7 (7)(a) [of the CPR] that part of the Order of 25 July 2014 should not be binding on Tom and Freya. The relevant part of the Order was the approval of the settlement of the proceedings. Mr Seitler explained that if the approval of the settlement was not binding on Tom and Freya then they would not be bound by the release (contained in the settlement) of all claims against Confiànce. Tom and Freya would then be able to bring claims against Confiànce. Tom and Freya recognise that the settlement between Mr Barker and Confiànce has happened and they do not seek to have that settlement rescinded; accordingly, the result would remain that the Trust and the Sub-Trust no longer have effect. However, Mr Seitler submits that Tom and Freya would be able to pursue claims against Confiànce under two principal heads. The first head would be a claim for breach of trust as a result of Confiànce making loans to Mr Barker prior to the order of 25 July 2014. The second head of claim would be that Confiànce acted in breach of trust in agreeing the compromise with Mr Barker and, more particularly, allowing the compromise to go before the court for approval without the interests of Tom and Freya being properly protected. If Tom and Freya established that Confiànce had committed a breach of trust in parting with the trust assets to Mr Barker, then Tom and Freya would seek to follow or trace those trust assets and/or claim against Mr Barker by reason of his receipt of those assets.” </p>

This point arises on the assumed basis that the Trust and the Deed of Gift were otherwise effective. If so, what was their effect? There are only two possibilities. Either, the family beneficiaries were excluded from benefitting at any time and the Trust complied with section 28 or the family beneficiaries were not excluded from benefitting with the consequence that the Trust did not comply with section 28 and Mr Barker did not gain the intended tax advantages. In view of the Court of Appeal’s views as to the correct interpretation of section 28, Mr Barker had failed to achieve what he wanted to achieve which was that the Trust did comply with section 28 and he obtained the various tax advantages and the family beneficiaries were capable of benefitting after his death. It is therefore plain that Mr Barker had made a mistake as to the effect of what he had done. The nature of the mistake would have entitled him to an order rescinding the Trust Deed and Deed of Gift ab initio. There were no identified defences to such a claim.

As to that, the Judge said in paragraph 82 of the Principal Judgment that he had “no hesitation in reaching the view that the settlement which had been proposed prior to 25 July 2014 was in the best interests of Tom and Freya”. He explained that he would “certainly” take that view if he took account of everything that had by then emerged, the “principal such matter” being the Court of Appeal decision. Even without that, he said in paragraph 83, “there were still powerful reasons why it would probably have been right for the court to approve the settlement” since Mr Barker “undoubtedly had a very strong case overall” and, “[i]f his case prevailed, the beneficiaries under the Trust would get nothing”. In the circumstances, the Judge considered that he would “probably” have approved the settlement even if he had held that Euan should not represent Tom and Freya and even if he had heard on behalf of Tom and Freya all of the arguments which were put on their behalf at the hearing of the application before him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Citing authorities ranging in date from 1727 to 1921, the Judge concluded in paragraph 26 of the Costs Judgment that there is “a long line of cases which establish the practice that in the case of an unsuccessful claim by a child claimant acting by a litigation friend, the usual order is that the litigation friend will be ordered to pay the successful defendant’s costs”. “In effect,” he observed in paragraph 28, “the courts treated the litigation friend as being responsible for the costs which would otherwise be ordered against the child if that party had been an adult”. The Judge considered, moreover, that “the reasoning in the earlier cases remains valid at the present time” (paragraph 30) and that “[t]he reasoning in those cases can readily be applied whether the litigation friend acts for a claimant or for a defendant” (paragraph 43). “If,” the Judge said in paragraph 46, “a distinction between a child claimant acting by a litigation friend and a child defendant so acting is considered to be a relevant distinction in a particular case then the court will have regard to that distinction when it considers all the circumstances of the case”, but “that does not mean that the court must apply an inflexible general rule”.

The governing rule is that the court has regard to all the circumstances of the case and it is open to the litigation friend to point to any circumstance as to their involvement in the litigation which might justify making a different order for costs from that which would normally be made against an adult party.” </p>

A defendant’s litigation friend, he argued, will not generally be ordered to pay costs. The true position, he submitted, is that an order will not be made against such a litigation friend unless there has been misconduct on his part. That conclusion is supported by both pre-CPR authorities and policy considerations. If defendants’ litigation friends were usually vulnerable to adverse costs orders, that would have a chilling effect on the willingness of suitable individuals to take on the responsibility of acting as such a litigation friend and so both compromise the protection of the rights of children and protected parties who are sued and create significant difficulties for the administration of justice. That litigation friends of defendants are in a significantly different position to those of claimants is, moreover, apparent from CPR 21.4(3)(c), which requires a claimant’s litigation friend, but not a defendant’s, to undertake to pay any costs which the child or protected party might be ordered to pay in relation to the proceedings. </p>

Among the points advanced were these. The proposition that a defendant’s litigation friend is not liable to pay costs in the absence of misconduct is not supported by the old case law and, in any event, is inconsistent with the broad discretion as to costs now conferred on the Court by section 51 of the 1981 Act. That a defendant’s litigation friend should generally be liable for costs where the defence has failed is sound in principle. A person becoming a litigation friend must appreciate that his conduct will directly impact on other parties and the costs they incur. Should no one be able and willing to act for a defendant, the Official Solicitor will step in and, further, the Court has a discretion to permit a child to conduct proceedings without a litigation friend. CPR 21.4(3)(c) is simply akin to requiring some security for costs where a claim is brought by a litigation friend, and CPR 21.9(6) points to a defendant’s litigation friend being liable for costs. </p>

Such a policy appears to me, I must confess, to be entirely sensible. It comes therefore as something of a surprise to discover that it has been suggested that any limitation should be held to be implied into the statutory provision which confers the relevant jurisdiction.”  </p>

A number of the decided cases have sought to catalogue the main principles governing the proper exercise of this discretion and their Lordships, rather than undertake an exhaustive further survey of the many relevant cases, would seek to summarise the position as follows. (1) Although costs orders against non-parties are to be regarded as ‘exceptional’, exceptional in this context means no more than outside the ordinary run of cases where parties pursue or defend claims for their own benefit and at their own expense. The ultimate question in any such ‘exceptional’ case is whether in all the circumstances it is just to make the order. It must be recognised that this is inevitably to some extent a fact-specific jurisdiction and that there will often be a number of different considerations in play, some militating in favour of an order, some against.

In their case the court’s usual approach is to give priority to the public interest in the funded party getting access to justice over that of the successful unfunded party recovering his costs and so not having to bear the expense of vindicating his rights. (3) Where, however, the non-party not merely funds the proceedings but substantially also controls or at any rate is to benefit from them, justice will ordinarily require that, if the proceedings fail, he will pay the successful party’s costs. The non-party in these cases is not so much facilitating access to justice by the party funded as himself gaining access to justice for his own purposes. He himself is ‘the real party’ to the litigation, a concept repeatedly invoked throughout the jurisprudence …. (4) Perhaps the most difficult cases are those in which non-parties fund receivers or liquidators (or, indeed, financially insecure companies generally) in litigation designed to advance the funder’s own financial interests. Since this particular difficulty may be thought to lie at the heart of the present case, it would be helpful to examine it in the light of a number of statements taken from the authorities ….  </p>

In the light of these authorities their Lordships would hold that, generally speaking, where a non-party promotes and funds proceedings by an insolvent company solely or substantially for his own financial benefit, he should be liable for the costs if his claim or defence or appeal fails. As explained in the cases, however, that is not to say that orders will invariably be made in such cases, particularly, say, where the non-party is himself a director or liquidator who can realistically be regarded as acting rather in the interests of the company (and more especially its shareholders and creditors) than in his own interests…. 33. … The authorities establish that, whilst any impropriety or the pursuit of speculative litigation may of itself support the making of an order against a non-party, its absence does not preclude the making of such an order.” </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Slaughter v Talbot </span>(1739) Barnes 128, the Court considered that “by the uniform practice of all the Courts the prochein amie is liable to costs”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Beavan v Beavan </span>(1862) 31 LJNS 166, a guardian who had instituted divorce proceedings on behalf of a 16 year old who had married a rather older prostitute was ordered to give security for the wife’s costs, the Judge Ordinary, Sir Cresswell Cresswell, holding at 166 that “the guardian, as she had instituted the suit, was liable for the wife’s costs”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Dyke v Stephens </span>(1885) 30 Ch D 189, Pearson J observed at 190 that a next friend “is not a party to the action, he is put there simply to protect the interest of the infant, and to shew that the interest is of such nature that he is willing to guarantee costs, and in making himself liable for costs he is in no way a party to the action”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Slingsby v Attorney-General </span>(1916) 32 TLR 364, an order for costs was made against the guardian of an infant petitioner, counsel for the guardian recognising in submissions at 367 that “it was usual where an action was brought by an infant plaintiff to order the next friend personally to pay the costs”. In <span style="font-style:italic">Rutter v Rutter </span>[1921] P 136, it was “not disputed that by the practice of the King’s Bench and Chancery Divisions the next friend of an infant plaintiff is liable for the costs of the suit”, but it was argued on behalf of the guardian of the infant husband whose petition had failed that “no such status as that of next friend is known in the Divorce Division where the rules provide that an infant must sue by his guardian” (see 140).

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Minors) </span>[1982] 1 WLR 438, Ormrod LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, distinguished between custody cases, where the Official Solicitor “is much more than a mere guardian ad litem”, and cases where the Official Solicitor “was acting as guardian ad litem to an infant who was made a defendant in ordinary litigation in which the infant had to be made a defendant to enable the plaintiff to proceed with his action” (see 442). In the latter class of case, Ormrod LJ explained at 442, “a plaintiff is obliged by R.S.C., Ord. 80, r. 6, to apply to the court for the appointment of a guardian ad litem and may not proceed with his action until a guardian ad litem is appointed”, but “[n]o such provision applies to either wardship proceedings or proceedings concerning children under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973” where “[t]he child is not a necessary party and the case can, and usually does, proceed without making the child a party to the proceedings”. These authorities, therefore, had no application to the case before the Court and decisions such as <span style="font-style:italic">Eady v Elsdon </span>did not apply. There is, Ormrod LJ said at 443, “no rule of practice in wardship and custody cases which requires the court to order a plaintiff in wardship proceedings to pay the Official Solicitor's costs, unless there are special reasons to the contrary”, but neither is there any rule of practice in such cases that the parties should pay their own costs, unless there are special reasons to the contrary: section 51 of the 1981 Act </p>

In each case, in my opinion, the decision lies in the unfettered discretion of the trial judge, to be exercised in accordance with similar general principles. One of these, in my view, is that, as the parties, in whatever circumstances, have become involved in a situation in which it has become necessary to seek the assistance of the Official Solicitor, it is not unreasonable for him to ask that they should meet or contribute towards the cost of his intervention. In some cases there may be factors or considerations which will lead the court to refuse such a request.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In practice, the Court may not often need to consider whether to make an order under section 51 of the 1981 Act against a litigation friend of a claimant. By virtue of CPR 21.4(3)(c) and 21.5, a person must give an undertaking as to costs to become a litigation friend without a Court order. Likewise, CPR 21.6(5) bars the Court from appointing anyone as a litigation friend who does not satisfy “the conditions in rule 21.4(3)”, and one such condition, in the case of a litigation friend of a claimant, is that an undertaking as to costs is given. A claimant’s litigation friend will commonly, therefore, be answerable for costs as a result of having given an undertaking without the Court making an order for costs against him pursuant to section 51. </p>

That would reflect both the sense of CPR 21.4(3)(c) and pre-CPR authority. As long ago as 1739, a “prochain amie” was liable to costs by “the uniform practice of all the Courts” and subsequent cases show that the practice endured. The Judge considered that nothing in the 1981 Act or the CPR undermined the reasoning in the earlier cases or called for it to be reconsidered (see paragraph 31 of the Costs Judgment). In my view, it remains the case that liability for costs should typically be imposed on a claimant’s litigation friend, but with the important caveat that, when deciding whether to make such an order, the Court is exercising a discretion and entitled to have regard to the particular circumstances of the case. </p>

While a claimant’s litigation friend must supply an undertaking as to costs in accordance with CPR 21.4(3)(c), the CPR, unlike the FPR, impose no such requirement on a defendant’s litigation friend. Mr Cloherty sought to dismiss CPR 21.4(3)(c) as “simply akin to requiring some security for costs where a claim is brought by a litigation friend”, but an undertaking in compliance with CPR 21.4(3)(c) creates only a personal obligation and, even if security were conferred, the fact would remain that it had been thought right to differentiate between a claimant’s litigation friend (who has to give an undertaking) and a defendant’s (who need not). It is significant, too, that, by virtue of CPR 21.2 and 21.3, the general rule is that a claim simply cannot proceed against a child or protected party unless a litigation friend is appointed. A step taken before a child or protected party has a litigation friend has no effect unless the court orders otherwise, CPR 21.3(4) explains; </p>

Children and protected parties who are being sued need litigation friends both so that their rights are protected and because the litigation cannot otherwise proceed. Yet there must be a risk that, if a defendant’s litigation friend were usually vulnerable to an adverse costs order, that would deter suitable individuals from taking on the role. Mrs Talbot Rice downplayed the potential difficulties on the footing that, if no one else is able and willing to act for a child or protected party, the Official Solicitor will step in, but the Official Solicitor is not willing to accept a case unless there is adequate provision for payment of her own costs. More than that, a general principle that a defendant’s litigation friend should bear the claimant’s costs of a successful claim would, on the face of it, expose the Official Solicitor to the prospect of a costs order against her if the claim succeeded, yet it seems most unlikely that the Official Solicitor would wish to run that risk. Mrs Talbot Rice also pointed out that CPR 21.2(3) gives the Court a discretion to permit a child to conduct proceedings without a litigation friend, but exercise of that power would only rarely provide an adequate solution in the case of a child and could never do so with a protected party; </p>

It is not easy to see why a defendant’s litigation friend should be in a worse position. While the litigation friend might be said to have controlled the defendant’s participation in the litigation, the same might be said of the company director. That tends to suggest that a defendant’s litigation friend who does not stand to benefit substantially should generally escape liability for a claimant’s costs unless guilty of impropriety or bad faith; </p>

Far from the Official Solicitor being ordered to pay a claimant’s costs where a defendant on whose behalf she has acted has failed, the cases show that a claimant (or other applicant)<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>may be ordered to pay the Official Solicitor’s own costs, and that even where the claimant/applicant has not asked the Official Solicitor to become involved.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, it is not suggested that Ms Glover acted in bad faith and she did not stand to gain a substantial personal benefit from the Twins’ Application. The Judge noted that “if Tom and Freya did make a financial recovery as a result of these proceedings (and further proceedings) then there could be an element of an indirect benefit to Ms Glover”, since such a recovery would have alleviated the financial burden on her and perhaps enabled Tom and Freya to pay back debts she had incurred. He also, however, observed that the proceedings against Confiance which were contemplated “would have been for the benefit of Tom and Freya and not directly for the benefit of Ms Glover” and, as Mr Saoul pointed out, the period over which the financial burden on Ms Glover could have been eased would have been attenuated by the fact that Tom and Freya were already turning 16 when the Twins’ Application was issued. As for improper or unreasonable behaviour, the respondents argued that the Twins’ Application had poor to non-existent prospects of success and was speculative at best. In this connection, Mr Cloherty drew attention to paragraph 81 of the Costs Judgment, in which the Judge said that, by the time the Twins’ Application was initiated, Ms Glover “knew or ought to have known of the difficulties she would have to overcome” but “nonetheless went ahead”. He further relied on Lord Brown’s reference in <span style="font-style:italic">Dymocks </span>to “the pursuit of speculative litigation” being capable of supporting the making of an order against a non-party. To my mind, however, the Twins’ Application was not so obviously flawed as to justify a costs order against Ms Glover. A key element in the Judge’s analysis in the Principal Judgment was that section 28 of the IHTA was to be construed in the way that the Court of Appeal thought was probably correct in the Negligence Claim, but the Court of Appeal’s judgments were not available until December 2017, by which time the Twins’ Application had not only been issued but had its first hearing day. Beyond that, the matter was the subject of sustained argument by leading counsel at a hearing extending over, in all, several days and the Judge spoke of the Twins’ Application having to overcome “difficulties” rather than of its being hopeless. Nor do I consider that the fact that costs orders made in favour of Mr Barker and Confiance in the Twin Benefits Proceedings have not been satisfied provides a sufficient reason to impose liability for costs on Ms Glover in the present context. Ms Glover was never herself a party to the Twin Benefits Proceedings or under any liability in respect of their costs. While, moreover, Ms Glover may have been a director and shareholder of Twin </p>

It would be perverse, Mr Saoul said, if Mr Barker’s misconduct enabled him to obtain a costs order against Ms Glover. </p>

The question there was whether liquidators could obtain security for costs against companies appealing against decisions on proofs of debt. The Privy Council concluded that it was proper to award security for costs. Lord Neuberger said in paragraph 31 that “it must be right, at least as a general rule, that, when deciding whether a particular application is an ‘action, suit, or other … proceeding’ or an ‘action or other proceedings’, the court must look at the substance of the application as opposed to its strict form”.

Such an application would usually be made in a new action and there could be no question but that the new action would constitute ‘proceedings’ for the purposes both of section 74 [of the Cayman Islands Joint Stock Companies Act 1857 (as revised)] and of Order 23 [of the Grand Court Rules 1995]. But, if the original action were technically still on foot, the application to set aside the compromise could be made by interlocutory motion in the still existing action: see <span style="font-style:italic">Gilbert v Endean</span> (1878) 9 Ch D 259 and the remark of Jessel MR, at p 266, that the object of the motion was to decide ‘a substantial question between the parties’. In such a case the applicant would be in the position of a plaintiff and the respondent in the position of a defendant whatever their respective roles in the existing action. The ability of the court to entertain an application by the respondent for security for costs of the applicant’s application to set aside the compromise could surely not be denied on the ground that the application was not in form an originating process and so did not constitute </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">However, Lord Neuberger, with whom Lord Rodger, Baroness Hale and Sir Jonathan Parker concurred,  specifically stated, in paragraph 34, that he would prefer to leave entirely open questions such as whether and if so when it is possible or appropriate to order security for costs in connection with an application to set aside a compromise of an action. Moreover, the issue on this appeal differs significantly from that before the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">GFN SA v Bancredit Cayman Ltd</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic">GFN</span>, the Privy Council was concerned with whether a particular type of application was an “action, suit, or other … proceeding” or an “action or other proceeding”. In the present case, what ultimately matters is what impact Tom and Freya’s role should have on the exercise by the Court of its discretion under section 51 of the 1981 Act. It will be apparent from what I have already said that, in my view, a litigation friend for an ordinary claimant should typically bear the costs of a successful defendant while costs liability should be imposed on an ordinary defendant’s litigation friend much less often. Where, however, a party for whom a litigation friend acts is neither a conventional claimant nor a conventional defendant, the Court’s decision on the litigation friend’s liability for costs need not be governed by simple characterisation of the party as claimant or defendant. The Court should consider whether the nature and circumstances of the party’s participation point to application of, on the one hand, the approach adopted in relation to claimants’ litigation friends or, on the other hand, that adopted in relation to defendants’ litigation friends before arriving at an overall conclusion as to how it should exercise its discretion on the particular facts. </p>

The result was that the Main Proceedings were “deliberately concealed” from Tom, Freya and Ms Glover (paragraph 72), they were “deliberately not inform[ed] … of a proposed compromise so as to prevent them expressing their views upon that compromise” (paragraph 69), “information relevant to the court’s decision was deliberately withheld from the court” (paragraph 73) and a representation order was used “as a means of keeping Tom and Freya (and Ms Glover) in the dark as to what was happening” (paragraph 71). The “natural consequence” was that Ms Glover “has harboured a strong sense of injustice and a belief that Tom and Freya have been unfairly treated” (paragraph 76). The Twins’ Application represented an attempt to remedy what had gone wrong. Initially, Tom and Freya specifically asked to be joined as defendants. That head of relief was not pursued beyond the first hearing of the application, but it remains the case that Tom and Freya were responding to the Main Proceedings and their exclusion from them. If, as was hoped, success in the Twins’ Application had enabled them to mount a claim against Confiance for breach of trust, they would clearly have been claimants in that context. What was at issue in the Twins’ Application itself, however, was whether Tom and Freya were bound by a compromise of which they had not been informed in order to prevent them expressing views on it. In the circumstances, whether or not Tom and Freya would have been regarded as “claimants” for security for costs purposes in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">GFN SA v Bancredit Cayman Ltd</span>, it appears to me that it is the approach governing costs orders against litigation friends of <span style="font-style:italic">defendants </span>that ought to be applied; and I have already said that, on that basis, I would not consider costs orders against Ms Glover to be appropriate. </p>
