The nursery also reported that two other children had seemingly contracted eye infections at about the same time as R, although the nature of the organism causing those infections has not been ascertained.

Case management hearings took place in June, July, and September 2020 with an appropriate overview of the expert and other evidence filed and matters of disclosure to and by the police, who by then had mounted an investigation. Ultimately, neither R nor the parents have been interviewed by the police and no further criminal proceedings are anticipated at this stage, it appearing to have been determined after an initial question and answer session that R was not a competent witness. The final hearing of the care proceedings was listed for five days before HHJ Hess commencing on 30 November 2020 with a pre-trial review hearing on 21 October 2020.  </p>

Put differently, in what way can it be contended as in the children’s best interests to pursue findings of an attributability of harm against the parents when they are merely one of a uncertainly large class of potential perpetrators of albeit clearly established harm”.   </p>

The parents, unlike the LA, did not accept that there had been sexual abuse which potentially presented ‘protection’ issues, and the judge should have addressed this point. As it was, it was impossible to know from the judgment on what basis the judge had proceeded. The question of harm and attributability were conflated. The judge had fallen into error, led by the error of the LA, in analysing the development of Mr Greenhouse’s opinion as to timing and sequence of infection. His judgment contemplated a time frame of two years, inevitably increasing the size of the possible pool of perpetrators and envisioning the creation of an unwieldy court logistical exercise. In any event, it was wrong not to contemplate whether the court forensic investigative process would establish that, on the balance of probabilities the infection occurred within  the shorter periods of two weeks or months before appearance of the eye infection.  </p>

Dependent upon the original site of infection, the LA’s analysis of the evidence suggested a time frame that could mean a dormant infection over two years, and not the one to two months posited by the CG before us. This “open ended period of incubation” had obvious consequences. The fact that “these difficulties may have been ironed out in cross examination” did not mean that the judge had been wrong to consider that the  “distinct paucity of evidence apart from the fact of [R’s] infection with gonorrhoea itself, to assist the court in making anything more than nominal findings of attributability in respect of the parents on the facts of this case.” The court was entitled to examine Mr Greenhouse’s evidence in the round in considering the application for withdrawal and assess the  potential impact those inconsistencies might have on the ability of the local authority to prove its case without the necessity of hearing the evidence itself.  </p>

Whilst the application is subject to court scrutiny in accordance with FPR 29, part 4, it is nevertheless a difficult, important, and significant decision for a local authority to take and will not be undertaken lightly. In this case, and particularly in light of the conclusion I reach, I think it right to record that the application was obviously made in good faith after anxious, although in my view inexact, scrutiny of the evidence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">First, a literal reading  of [13 (iii)] of the judgement below, makes it difficult to discern whether HHJ Hess proceeded to deal with the application on the basis that this was a case in which the threshold criteria would not be met on his rough evaluation of the evidence as it stood  or, was a case where in short parlance, he must apply the ‘A County Council’ principles he refers to in [11] of his judgment. However, assuming that he regarded it fell into the second category, not least because  I do not think it reasonably can be  said to be “obvious” that the evidence was insufficient to proceed, as  Mr Josty and  Mr Bond realistically concede on behalf of F and M, (whilst re-iterating their client’s disquiet and scepticism), the judgment does not address the fact that the parents’ do not accept that R has been subjected to sexual abuse. Whilst not necessarily determinative of the application,  it is a significant factor in the exercise of judicial discretion whether to permit withdrawal of the proceedings, and the judge’s reasoning and conclusions on the point should have been addressed in the judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In this case the parents do not only deny their participation in any such abuse that may be established but also, in different degrees, the premise that abuse has occurred at all. This has implications for the future parenting and protection of the children and in my view calls for a clear determination as to whether, on the balance of probabilities, R has  been victim  of sexual abuse . </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Secondly, it appears after a careful examination of the several reports and emails prepared by Mr Greenhouse, that the judge was unintentionally misled as to a crucial fact which would impact upon whether a meaningful investigation of  attribution was possible, again assuming that harm is found in accordance with Children Act 1989, s 31(2)a.  As indicated above, HHJ Hess refers to Ms Stoten’s evidence including the following: “ … the likely primary site for infection (i.e. the vagina) is ambiguous and could be anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months <span style="text-decoration:underline">to a couple of years</span>” (my underlining) in [7] of his judgment and obviously accepts it as the basis of his determination.

The two-year period was quoted specifically in reference to the former. The time frame is considerably less in the latter. I accept Ms Fottrell QC’s analysis on this evidential point but think it likely that we have had greater assistance in analysing the evidence than did HHJ Hess, as appears from Mr Morgan’s claim that the CG did not dispute the potential size of the pool of perpetrators in the court below.  However, HHJ Hess’s conclusions in [13(ii)] of his judgment are necessarily undermined.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">In this respect, the fact that Mr Greenhouse’s opinion was ‘developed’ (as Ms Fottrell QC describes it to be)  in response to a repeated and regular succession  of written questions and follow up requests for clarification, suggests that it was simply not compatible with  a paper interrogation and called for oral cross-examination; not least since his opinion formed  a corner-stone in the proceedings, and   the criticism of it was centre stage to the LA application.  I have little doubt that HHJ Hess would have benefitted from hearing Mr Greenhouse’s evidence  under challenge and may well have rejected or finessed the LA analysis otherwise put before him, with obvious implications as to the utility of proceeding further in accordance with the child protection and welfare principles he refers to in [13 (i) and (v)] of this judgement.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Further, I regard  it right to observe  that whilst Mr Greenhouse attaches several meaningful caveats to his opinion which may not have ‘assisted’ the LA to a clear view, and which may well account for the way in which the judge articulates the issue in [13(iii)] and, in fairness to the parents have at least contributed to their scepticism that R has been sexually abused at all, that it is right that he should have done so  in accordance  with his duty as an expert witness to bring any matters that may undermine the integrity of his opinion to the attention of the court. The caveats do not undermine his “credibility” or otherwise undermine his expertise or reliability.  It should also be recorded that, subject to these caveats his opinion on the relevance of a positive test for gonorrhoeal infection in a pre-pubertal child and the consequent likelihood of sexual abuse remained firm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">Realistically, I would accept HHJ Hess’s conclusion regarding the improbability of a confession from the witness box and see the potential limitations in the “circumstantial evidence” against the parents which Ms Fottrell QC seeks to rely upon in support of ground 2. The cross-examination of Mr Greenhouse and others may reveal further ‘known unknowns’ which are incapable of resolution and may even militate against  a finding of harm on the balance of probabilities, or otherwise confirm the impossibility of narrowing down the pool of potential perpetrators for any practical welfare purpose and substantiate the decision reached by HHJ Hess now under review. However, it is also possible that a more certain picture will emerge which will inform future care planning – if state intervention is warranted at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.54in">A shorter time frame of possible non-accidental infective process, if that is what the judge hearing all the evidence determines it to be, makes the identification of a definitive pool, which may include either of the parents, a more feasible proposition. Mr Morgan’s submissions that the care plan would not change, even if the parents were included in a pool of possible perpetrators, is a bold submission in the absence of knowledge of what detailed findings might be made at the hearing,<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>and is also against the evidence filed by the LA in terms that the parenting assessments did not support the care plan if either parent was found to be a perpetrator. What is more, the LA no doubt will wish to consider the CG’s views if the threshold criteria are established. </p>
