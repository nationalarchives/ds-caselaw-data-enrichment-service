	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal against the decision of the Rt Hon Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division (‘the President’) who, in the exercise of the family court’s jurisdiction to make  a female genital mutilation protection order  under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (‘the FGMA 2003’), held that a family court is not bound to take, even as a starting point, a previous assessment or determination of risk of female genital mutilation (‘FGM’) made by the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal (‘FtT (IAC)’) in its determination of an asylum application based upon the risk of FGM on return.  His decision was made on 25 September 2019 and is reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A Child: Female Genital Mutilation: Asylum)</span> [2019] EWHC 2475 (Fam).  Although this appeal was heard in public, an order was made to protect the identity of the child concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The President concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A </span>that family courts have the broad discretion described in the FGMA 2003 to take into account all of the relevant circumstances when considering whether to make a protection order.  In other words, a family court is not constrained by any prior conclusion of the FtT (IAC) and can give it such weight as it might consider appropriate in its own assessment.  The Secretary of State for the Home Department challenges this conclusion and submits that the assessment of risk undertaken by the FtT (IAC) is to be taken as the starting point or default position in any subsequent assessment of risk by the family court in considering whether to make a protection order.  </p>

A and her brothers were dependents for the purposes of that application.  No separate asylum application was made on behalf of A.  A’s mother claimed that she was at risk on return because of her conversion from Sunni to Shia Islam and that A was at risk of FGM.   Although her account has at times differed, A’s mother claimed that A’s father and his extended family were in favour of FGM and wanted A to undergo the practice. A’s mother had undergone FGM as a child in Sudan, and reported that two of her sisters died as a result of the practice which continues in the extended family so that three of her nieces have also been subjected to it. </p>

The mother’s appeal against that decision was dismissed by the FtT (IAC) on 25 July 2017, the parties to the appeal being the mother (as appellant) and the Secretary of State (as respondent).  The judge in the FtT (IAC), Judge Monson, did not find the mother to be a credible witness and, in respect of A, held that “there are not substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of her being subjected to any form of FGM”. Permission to appeal was refused by both the FtT (IAC) and the Upper Tribunal (‘UT’); and, on 14 May 2018, Holman J refused the mother’s application for leave to apply for judicial review of the UT’s decision. The mother’s appeal rights were accordingly exhausted and, on 18 September 2018, she was served with directions for the family’s removal to Bahrain, with the deportation date set for 27 September 2018. </p>

An assessment was undertaken by Barnardo’s in 2017 which recommended the making of a FGM protection order under the FGMA 2003 if the proposed return was to be pursued. The engagement by Barnardo’s and SCC ended when the family remained in the UK, because it was considered that there is no risk of FGM to A while she resides in the UK.  </p>

In fact, as the helpful observations from Black LJ (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> (see paragraph 32 above) demonstrate, the approach to risk assessment in a family case is a different exercise from that undertaken in the context of immigration and asylum. The family court has a duty by FGMA 2003, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to ‘have regard to all the circumstances’ and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving to assess the risk and the need for an FGM protection order. Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not compatible with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction.” </p>

In approaching an asylum/humanitarian protection claim, the Home Office looks to see whether the person concerned has a well-founded fear of persecution or is at real risk of serious harm for a non-Convention reason. The approach to risk is not the same as that taken in a family case. In a family case, establishing risk is a two-stage process. First, the court considers what facts are established on the balance of probabilities; then it proceeds to consider whether those facts give rise to a risk of harm, see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Children)</span> [2013] UKSC 9 […] In contrast, in an asylum/humanitarian protection claim, the material presented by the claimant is looked at as a whole with a view to determining whether there is a well-founded fear of persecution or substantial grounds for believing that a person would face a real risk of serious harm, a reasonable degree of likelihood of serious harm being what is required.

Again, Mr McKendrick did not suggest otherwise.  We accept that an assessment of risk made by one court or tribunal may be a relevant consideration for a subsequent assessment by a different court or tribunal: but, whether it is relevant at all and, if so, the weight to be given to the earlier assessment, are matters for the subsequent court or tribunal.

The admission of evidence before a family court is governed by the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  The admission of evidence is considered by a judge during case management.  There is no right to file and serve evidence without the family court’s permission (see, for example, rule 25.4(2)).  Quite apart from the application to that exercise of the overriding objective in rules 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 and the active case management principles in rules 1.4 and 4.1, which are mirrored and described in detailed practice directions, there is a specific and simple test which family courts must apply relating to the admission of expert evidence which can be found in part 25 at rule 25.4(3).  That test is whether the evidence is “necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings”.  We accept that may require a family court exercising its power to make a FGM protection order to consider, in the light of a prior finding by a tribunal in a different context, the nature and extent of the evidence upon which that earlier finding was made; and whether (and, if so, what) further evidence is required.  However, there is no need for any additional test, alternative wording or any gloss on the rule that is applicable to the circumstances of this case, as the Secretary of State suggests.   </p>

Or, as the Secretary of State put it: the principle of judicial comity prescribes that the family court should take the FtT (IAC)’s assessment of the risk of FGM as its starting point and only embark on a further enquiry if compelling or exceptional reasons demand it.

Whereas the family court is a court of record, the FtT (IAC) is not.  The FtT has the features of a court but is quintessentially an independent judicial tribunal which is a specialist administrative law decision maker.  The UT is a superior court of record that is able to bind itself and the FtT (IAC) but neither the Family Division of the High Court nor the family court can make a decision that has precedential effect in either the FtT (IAC) or the UT.

A child or young person in proceedings in the family court for a FGM protection order will be separately represented. She will have her own voice.  That is not the case in the tribunal in a case like this where a young person is not making her own asylum application but, like A, is the dependent of an adult who is.  As we have remarked, whether a person’s interests are a primary or paramount consideration can and sometimes does lead to a different decision on the same facts.  Furthermore, the assessments of risk being conducted are different.
