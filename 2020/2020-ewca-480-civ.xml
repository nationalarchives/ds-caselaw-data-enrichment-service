	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Appellant, Islandsbanki HF (“IB”) appeals against the order of Fancourt J, dated 19 July 2019, dismissing IB’s appeal against the order of Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Jones, dated 22 February 2019 (as varied on 13 March 2019). By that order, ICC Judge Jones dismissed IB’s bankruptcy petition in respect of the third respondent, Mr Kevin Stanford, which had been presented on 6 April 2017 (the “IB Petition”) in respect of a debt of approximately £1.3 million, and instead adjudged Mr Stanford bankrupt upon a petition which was second in time, having been presented by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) on 22 August 2017 in respect of a debt of around £7 million. Unusually, in this case, three bankruptcy petitions had been presented in relation to Mr Stanford, the third in time having been presented by Shineclear Holdings Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands which is controlled by Kaupthing Bank, in respect of debt for around £6 million.  </p>

In a letter from their solicitors, DLA Piper UK LLP, dated 6 March 2020, they confirmed, amongst other things, that they did not intend to appear or be represented before the court but would abide by its decision.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although a bankruptcy order has already been made against Mr Stanford, IB appeals for two main reasons. First, had an order been made on the IB petition, the presentation of which preceded HMRC’s petition by some four months, the powers contained in sections 339 – 342 of the Insolvency Act 1986, (setting aside transactions at an undervalue and preferences) would have been available to his trustees in bankruptcy in respect of transactions which post-dated the presentation of the IB petition, rather than HMRC’s petition on 22 August 2017, and section 284 (dispositions of property made by the bankrupt rendered prima facie void) would have taken effect from the presentation of the IB petition. It appears from the evidence filed on behalf of Kaupthing Bank, the largest supporting creditor, and by Mr Stanford himself, that there may be a number of substantial transactions prior to August 2017 which would be susceptible to challenge. They are of particular significance in this case as the three petition debts total in excess of £14 million and Mr Stanford currently has insufficient funds to pay them. Secondly, the costs of the IB petition are considerable.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The IB petition is based on an unpaid Icelandic judgment debt from 2013 which together with interest, is now in excess of £1.5 million sterling equivalent. The judgment was given against Mr Stanford in the Reykjanes District Court in Iceland on 26 June 2013 for ISK 74,095.630.000 plus legal costs of ISK 132,900.00 (the “Icelandic judgment”). A certificate was issued by the Icelandic court on 16 October 2013, pursuant to Articles 54 – 58 of the Lugano Convention. IB applied to register the Icelandic judgment in England and Wales on 16 March 2016.  A registration order was sealed on 23 March 2016 (the “Registration Order”).   </p>

This point, amongst others, was taken by Mr Burkitt, on behalf of Mr Stanford, before ICC Judge Jones and is recorded, along with other matters in what the ICC Judge describes as “a troubling catalogue of errors”, at [30] of his judgment.  The ICC Judge concluded, however, as follows:  </p>

So far as the validity of the Writ of Control is concerned, I observed during the hearing on 20 December 2018 that this could be investigated by reviewing the court file in the Queen’s Bench Division pending the next return date. That would have been the appropriate course but on 22 February Mr Burkitt accepted that no further enquiries have been made. In those circumstances, I conclude that Mr Stanford has not satisfied the burden upon him of challenging the authenticity of the Writ of Control.”   </p>

In summary, it is said that the Judge erred in law in holding that CPR r 3.10 and/or Rule 12.64 of the Insolvency Rules 2016 cannot be used to validate a writ of control issued in derogation of the Lugano Convention because: (a) there is no prescribed sanction for execution prior to the end of the one month period for appealing a registration order, whether under Article 47(3) or CPR r 74.9; (b) IB is not seeking to vary the Lugano Convention but to cure defective execution or a procedural irregularity arising in the domestic insolvency proceedings;  and (c) the writ was voidable rather than void and had not been set aside. Therefore, the error of procedure did not invalidate what followed unless the Court ordered otherwise; and in any event, the court had a discretion or power to waive the defect under CPR r 3.10(b); and the Judge did not apply the “Vinos” principle properly or at all. Mr England also referred to the court’s inherent jurisdiction and to CPR rules 3.1(2)(m) and 3.1(7) as the potential source of the discretion upon which he seeks to rely. </p>

The Lugano Convention is concerned with the jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and applies in relation to the Icelandic judgment. It provides in its preamble that the Contracting Parties had determined “to strengthen in their territories the legal protection of persons therein established” and: “CONSIDERING that it is necessary for this purpose to determine the international jurisdiction of the courts, to facilitate recognition, and to introduce an expeditious procedure for securing the enforcement of judgments, authentic instruments and court settlements”. </p>

It is for this very reason that execution is not permitted until the period for an appeal against the registration order has expired or the appeal has been dealt with.

In other words, it seems to me that on a proper construction of section 4A(3), the reference to rules of court is to the relevant provisions of CPR Part 74 itself and not to the provisions of CPR Part 3 as Mr England would have it.  </p>

Accordingly, any attempt to remedy the premature issue and execution under the Writ of Control by means of an exercise of the discretion under CPR r3.10(b) or the use of CPR r3.1(2)(m) or 3.1(7) (or the inherent jurisdiction of the court, for that matter) would fundamentally undermine Article 47(3) and section 4A(3) in a way which is impermissible.   </p>

That question was dependent upon which court was first seised of proceedings within the meaning of Article 21 of the 1968 Lugano Convention. That, in turn, was dependent upon whether the court had power by virtue of CPR r3.10 and 6.9 to determine that the service of documents on a particular date, constituted sufficient service for the court then to be seised of the proceedings as definitively pending before it, and, if so, whether the court ought in its discretion to exercise that power.

In this case, by contrast an exercise of the discretion under CPR r3.10(b) in order to validate the Writ of Control, despite the fact that it was issued during a period in which execution was prohibited by Article 47(3), would have the effect of undermining the Convention itself.      </p>

Accordingly, it seems to me that it was inherent in the Registration Order itself that it could not form the basis of any lawful form of enforcement, including the issue of the Writ of Control, until that period had expired. Although, in my judgment, the Judge was right to decide that the Writ of Control was prima facie valid until set aside, it equally seems to me that the court was obliged to set it aside as soon as it came to its attention, in this case on the bankruptcy petition; and that the steps taken pursuant to it also had to be set aside in the same way.  </p>

It was liable to be set aside at any time by the debtor or by the court of its own motion because it had been unlawfully issued.

In essence, it was that because the Registration Order had not been received by Mr Stanford until 22 May 2017, and the one month period for appealing it ran from that date, the purported execution which took place before the one month period began to run, was not unlawful. It seems to me that this argument is hopeless. As ICC Judge Jones put it, the time specified for an appeal against the Registration Order remained extant when purported execution took place.
