The counterclaim was made against the Bank and its chairman, Mr Alexander Savelyev (“Mr Savelyev”), the second claimant, (together the “respondents”) for unlawfully causing the appellants harm under article 1064 of the Russian Civil Code (“article 1064”) amounting to some US$467 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Justice Hildyard tried the case over 46 sitting days between 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 and 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016.  He delivered his judgment almost 22 months later on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2018.  The Bank succeeded on all its debt claims, and there is no appeal from that part of his order.  The judge dismissed the appellants’ counterclaims.  He declined, however, to make the negative declarations that the respondents had sought as to the absence of any dishonesty or deceit, and the appellants’ alleged bad faith in raising their counterclaims.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">In refusing the negative declarations, the judge injected some uncertainty into his findings by saying at [1633] that he had rejected the counterclaims, not as a fiction dishonestly contrived, but on the basis that they had “not been established having regard to the strength of the evidence that was necessary to discharge the burden of proof”.  He referred at [1634] to his having harboured, throughout the case, before, during and after the hearing, a nagging and discomfiting feeling.  That feeling was that “the evidence by which alone the case is to be decided may not have revealed the whole truth; and that the very different conditions in Russia may mean that what seems improbable, or at least not probable, looked at through the lens of a different jurisdiction accustomed to different conditions, may yet have occurred”.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge went on at [1634] to say that the counterclaim had “always faced the difficulty that it relied on proof of the inherently improbable, and a burden of proof that could only be discharged by showing the facts to be incapable of innocent explanation such as to give rise to the inference of the conspiracy”.  The judge then listed at [1635] 10 specific features of the case that had “encouraged and fomented” his misgivings and which he thought “almost inevitably excited suspicion”.  </p>

First, they say that the judge misdirected himself as to the standard of proof, setting too high a bar for dishonesty to be established.  Secondly, they say that the judge adopted a piecemeal approach which prevented him from standing back to see how his misgivings built up to an irresistible inference of the fraud alleged.  In oral argument, they relied also on certain alleged inconsistencies in the judgment.  They pray in aid the judge’s delay and the inequality of arms between the two sides to the litigation. </p>

They point to the appellants’ dishonest defence of forgery and their persistent denial that they had signed up to the repo arrangements in the first place, as central planks of this argument.  They go so far as to say that it would have been perverse for the judge to have found in the appellants’ favour.  In the alternative, the respondents say that, even if the court does accede to the appellants’ submissions, the judge ought anyway to have dismissed the counterclaim on grounds of illegality.  Dr Arkhangelsky admitted in evidence that he paid some US$160 million in bribes to obtain licences for the acquisition and development of his port businesses. </p>

I should mention, however, that this judgment cannot possibly address all the facts and issues that the judge dealt with in his 390-page judgment.  Both parties have paid tribute to the comprehensive, indeed meticulous, nature of that judgment, and only one substantive finding of primary fact is challenged.  I will, therefore, allow the judge’s judgment to speak for itself, and assume that the reader of this decision will refer to it for the full facts.

The business losses of US$467 million were claimed on the basis that, absent the repo agreement and had the moratorium been adhered to, the appellants’ businesses would have been refinanced and made profits going forward.  That claim was, the appellants accept, unsustainable once the findings on forgery and the moratorium were not challenged. </p>

I will return to this aspect of the case in the context of the meaning of “harm” under article 1064.  But for present purposes, it suffices to understand that the remaining allegation of conspiracy is one that started in or after March 2009, related to the allegedly dishonest way in which the Bank pursued its enforcement strategy, including numerous legal proceedings and the auction sales of the appellants’ assets, and allegedly resulted in the loss of the surplus value of the assets, over and above the debts owed to the Bank. </p>

The judge held that the Bank was entitled to refuse loan extensions in March 2009 and did not engineer default ([831]-[833]), the Bank’s decision not to extend the loans was “readily understandable” ([993]-[994]).  It was under no duty to assist the borrower, rather it was entitled to act exclusively in its own interests subject to realising the security in a manner consistent with the law ([1016]-[1017]). </p>

Here, the judge held that the interpolation of the Original Purchasers under the repo arrangement was not intended to pave the way for a raid ([944]-[945]).  Whilst the respondents say that the judge found that the transfer of Scan shares from the Original Purchasers to the Subsequent Purchasers did not indicate any fraud, in fact he said that the Bank’s explanation was “neither very clear nor entirely compelling” ([1024]), and that it did not “necessarily [indicate] any appreciation or even private suspicion of fraud on the part of the Bank”, but did show the influence of Mrs Malysheva and Mr Sklyarevsky and their determination to bring all the Bank’s planning under their control.  The transfers directed by them also confirmed the direct control of the Bank over the Renord companies concerned ([1025]). </p>

The judge found at [1035] that Mr Savelyev and his managers avoided a meeting, and the Bank had no wish to negotiate with Dr Arkhangelsky.  He concluded at [1038] that he did not think that the inference that there was a raid, as distinct from a determination to wrest control from Dr Arkhangelsky as a means of securing the assets, could fairly be drawn from the facts “especially given the nature of the inference sought to be drawn”.  </p>

The judge found at [1044] that by the end of March 2009, the Bank was intent on removing from the appellants “any control over the assets of the OMG companies by any means available to it, without regard to the interests of the borrower or even the constraints of the legal arrangements that had given it legal power over the shares which enabled such control”.  He went on, however, to say that “though consistent with, that does not, in my view, necessarily mandate, the inference that the Bank was seeking to ‘raid’ the assets and parcel them out to its associated companies without accounting for their true value and intending to snaffle the surplus for its or their benefit free of any claims by OMG”.  It was, the judge thought, “consistent with a shorter term and less complex objective of protecting and ensuring efficient realization of its security by making sure that Dr Arkhangelsky had no legal right or means of practical access to the assets or </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.10in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.00in">control of the companies by which they were held”.  The respondents rely on the findings that Dr Arkhangelsky made no secret of his intention to use the “full armoury of tactics available to borrowers in Russia to delay or even defeat a lender” ([937]), the appellants’ success before some Russian courts told against their case that the final decisions showed political interference ([555(4)]), and the appellants’ initial success before the Russian courts meant that the Bank needed to find ways to protect its security ([1045]).  </p>

The respondents rely on the finding at [1321]-[1326] that the Gunard Lease in fact had “no impact on the auction sale process”.  It may be noted, however, that judge did say at [1326] that he could not “exclude the possibility that it was put in place and held in abeyance in case it was needed to depress demand and reduce the market value of the assets”, but the evidence was not sufficient to warrant such a finding. </p>

The judge held at [1089] that Dr Arkhangelsky was not forced to flee Russia, but it did become senseless and dangerous to return.  He did not make the finding that the appellants sought, namely that he was forced to leave as part of a State-organised conspiracy ([1075]-[1088]).   </p>

The respondents contend that the false evidence given by the Bank’s witnesses in the Morskoy Bank loan investigation has to be seen in the context of what the appellants were telling the Russian courts.  They submit that the judge found that their false evidence did not support the inference that the repo arrangements were fraudulent.  As the judge found: “the purpose of the concocted chorus was to support and substantiate the criminal proceedings, as part of the continuing war against Dr Arkhangelsky” ([1110]-[1115]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.04in">The thirteenth primary fact relied upon was that the events in the round displayed tell-tale signs of a classic raid. The judge found at [1131] that a “debateable” report produced by the appellants (as to which see [1127][1129]) offered “some confirmation of the prevalence of ‘raiding’ in the Russian Federation”, and found “its adumbration of the usual characteristics of the practice” useful, but thought that each case had to be assessed on its own facts.  In particular, he thought that it was the element of premeditation, and the ability unilaterally to bring about the premeditated result, which was the overall characteristic.  The respondents submit that the signs of a classic raid were irrelevant given the actual facts of this case ([1131]-[1134]).  The judge said at [1132] that he suspected that the most telling indication of a raid was “evidence of a premeditated decision on the part of the Bank … to deliberately engineer a default, thus enabling the Bank to be sure it can implement the raid, and at a time of its own choosing”.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.04in">The fourteenth primary fact relied on related to the true nature and purpose of the long series of transactions relating to the assets of OMG.  The appellants alleged that the sellers and purchasers at each of the auction sales of the pledged assets, and the ultimate purchasers, were connected parties owned or controlled by the Bank and/or Mr Savelyev. The respondents point to [1422], [1512], and [1525] as showing that the series of transactions involving the assets and auction sales amounted to nothing because the auction sales were not improper or rigged.  [1289]-[1290] show that the substantive validity of an auction is, under the applicable Russian law, the responsibility of the auction organisers, [1299] shows that the price is fixed by the court or a licensed appraiser, and [1345] shows that advertisement is a matter for the auction organisers.  The judge’s conclusions at [1346]-[1349] were, however, that “separate sales of assets flawed by fragmentation after inadequate marketing and advertisement” were obviously likely to have had some effect.  The fact was, as he said, that, in the event, no third parties emerged sufficiently interested even to attend at the various auctions.  On that basis, the judge thought it “more likely than not, that by this time the [respondents] and/or their associates had determined to retain the assets within their circle, with a view (by 2012) to realising their potential by substantial investment of which they had been starved: they were not interested so much in maximising recoveries in diminution of the loans, but in maximising benefit for themselves and their associates, subject only to formal compliance with the Russian law and practice”. The lack of third party interest “undoubtedly suited the [respondents] and may well have been vital for the accomplishment of what had become their preferred outcome”.  As the respondents submitted, however, the judge also found that it was not incumbent on them to do anything more than Russian law and practice required, and they were entitled to pursue their own interests as they perceived them.  At [1349], the judge found that a marketing exercise which appeared to the auction organisers to be compliant with their obligations was undertaken, unless there was sufficient evidence to establish that the organisers themselves were complicit. In that regard, the judge concluded at [1367] that the auction organisers might have been comforted in “the minimalist approach they seem to have adopted” by a perception that the respondents and/or Renord-Invest were not pressing, and had no wish, for anything more to be done.  He did not, however, think there was “any evidence that the auction organisers were themselves prevented or deterred by the [respondents] or Renord-Invest from further effort as regards presentation and marketing”.  There was no sufficient basis for inferring “from the way the assets were packaged, presented and marketed that the auction organisers’ marketing processes were designedly deficient in terms of the Russian law requirements”. At [1385]-[1386], the judge held that bid rigging did not suffice, because the appellants still needed to show that the result of the auctions would have been different, which they could not do. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.09in;margin-right:0.04in">The fifteenth primary fact relied on was that, even before December 2008, the Bank and/or Renord-Invest were interested in Western and Onega Terminals as complex income-generating assets with synergistic value which could be enhanced by acquiring control of all their assets, including unpledged assets.  The respondents point to [1335(10)], where the judge said that he tended to think that the respondents and/or their associates or loyal friends had resolved to retain within their circle and exploit Western Terminal for their own advantage, using the resources they could command, but he “did not think that gives rise to actionable impropriety, as long as fair value was achieved; and there is, as I say, nothing such as to dislodge the value accepted and approved by the Russian court” (and see [1335], [1338], and [1375-1377] as to the values achieved).  At [1413], the judge concluded that the available evidence did not substantiate the argument that ROK No. 1 Prichaly was a party to a dishonest conspiracy and acquired the Onega Terminal land at a gross and fraudulent undervalue: “[s]peculation may be understandable, suspicion inevitable: but it is not proof”.   [1415-7] show also that Dr Arkhangelsky was found to have benefitted from the sale of the Onega Terminal, because it reduced his exposure. </p>

At [237], the judge said that by the end of 2008, and probably throughout, “the reality was that OMG was substantially, if not completely, reliant on the Bank for financial support; and the Bank was aware of that, regarding it both as its exposure and its opportunity”.

The way that the assets at Western Terminal and at Onega Terminal were packaged for sale and the sequence in which they were sold does not seem likely to encourage third party interest nor to maximise the amounts applicable in reduction of indebtedness. The Counterclaimants’ fundamental allegation that this was a stratagem designed to reduce the amounts realised for payment down of indebtedness whilst maximising the benefit for the Claimants and their associates has throughout the case struck me as plausible. However, in the end I have concluded that the Bank being entitled to sell assets separately pledged separately, the justifications advanced by the Claimants for the packaging and process of sale are not so implausible that they must be rejected, bearing in mind the heavy onus of proof in the context of an assertion of dishonesty. </p>

The judge described it as “one of the features of this unusual case” that “whilst the main claims are founded and have eventually been established on the basis of Dr Arkhangelsky’s dishonesty, that finding has not of itself much assisted or been relevant in the determination of the Counterclaim, which has been barely concerned with his conduct and has focused almost entirely on the alleged dishonesty of the [respondents] and their associates”.  His rejection of the very serious allegations that the appellants put forward did not mean that he had rejected the claims as being “a fiction dishonestly contrived: only that the claims [had] not been established having regard to the strength of the evidence that was necessary to discharge the burden of proof”. </p>

Only the good faith enforcement of rights is sufficient to negate fault for the purposes of article 1064.   Furthermore, it was recorded at [862] that it was common ground between the Russian law experts that if the appellants succeed in proving their factual case as to the dishonest conspiracy to steal their assets, liability under article 1064 was established. </p>

The second principle, which is quite distinct, is that an allegation of fraud or dishonesty must be sufficiently particularised, and that particulars of facts which are consistent with honesty are not sufficient. This is only partly a matter of pleading. It is also a matter of substance. As I have said, the defendant is entitled to know the case he has to meet. But since dishonesty is usually a matter of inference from primary facts, this involves knowing not only that he is alleged to have acted dishonestly, but also the primary facts which will be relied upon at trial to justify the inference. At trial the court will not normally allow proof of primary facts which have not been pleaded, and will not do so in a case of fraud. It is not open to the court to infer dishonesty from facts which have not been pleaded, or from facts which have been pleaded but are consistent with honesty. There must be some fact which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be both pleaded and proved”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies. … </p>

As to the seriousness of the allegation, there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.” </p>

A further similar formulation is adopted at [1525(5)] in the judge’s conclusions on auction sales, where he says that the respondents’ justifications for the conduct he has found “are not so implausible that they must be rejected, bearing in mind the heavy onus of proof in the context of an assertion of dishonesty”.  In the context of his having determined that the respondents had behaved dishonestly, this approach distorted the appropriate standard of proof that I have already repeated several times. </p>

Each of those features either cast doubt on findings of fact that he had made in the respondents’ favour, or were, as I shall explain in the next section of this judgment, inconsistent with such findings.  [1630]-[1635] seem to me to imply that the judge may well not have considered the conspiracy alleged by the appellants to be in the least improbable, but that he had felt himself unable to determine that it had happened, because of the improperly high standard of proof that he was applying. </p>

It seems to me, however, that the paragraphs in which the errors that I have identified are found are crucial to the conspiracy alleged.  They relate, critically, to the extraordinary nature of the repo arrangements, to the dishonest pursuit of the Morskoy loan proceedings, to the evidence of state intervention, and most crucially to the conduct of the auction sales.  Reading the judgment, fairly and as a whole, has left me in little doubt that the judge has applied too high a standard of proof throughout his treatment of the appellants’ counterclaim.  The other paragraphs identified in [40] above are not so clearly inappropriate as those I have specifically mentioned in this section, but they lend some support to the view that the judge was proceeding on the basis of the wrong standard at all material stages. </p>

It was an entirely logical and comprehensive approach.  But nonetheless, I think there was substance in Mr Stroilov’s submission that, at no stage, did the judge properly take account of his previous findings in considering the likelihood of the later facts having occurred.  Put another way, what is lacking in the judgment is an element of standing back and considering the effects and implications of the facts he had found taken in the round.  Let me say at once that this approach would not necessarily be fatal to the findings he has made.  It would, in my judgment, depend on whether it could properly be said that the somewhat piecemeal approach that he adopted unfairly affected the judge’s evaluation of the facts.  I will come to that question shortly. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The first concerns the judge’s treatment of the important issue of loss.  It was common ground that the appellants had to prove they had sustained harm in order to succeed under article 1064.  That required there to be some financial loss.  I do not accept that the appellants had to be able to quantify that loss precisely, but they did have to show that they had sustained some financial harm as a result of the respondents’ alleged dishonest conspiracy.  At [1376], the judge found that the value established by the court-approved valuation and a pre-packaged sale did not mean that “the value so established was false or deficient”.  At [1386], he found that there was no evidence of any loss caused by bid-rigging.  At [1417], he found that Dr Arkhangelsky suffered no loss in relation to the sale of the Onega Terminal.  In [1552] the judge declined to determine substitute asset values.  When, however, he came to his final paragraphs at [1635(9)], he cast serious doubt over those previous findings by referring to the possibility that the respondents “may have procured for their associates, and may yet have some interest in, assets of far greater value than they have accounted for”. </p>

The Renord-Invest and SKIF companies could all be treated as within a group controlled by the Bank and/or Mr Savelyev [1205], and that obviously raised “a question as to the validity (and propriety) of the auction sales where the only participants were under common direction or control”.  At [1635(2)], the judge expressed his nagging suspicions about these facts and the respondents’ continuing denial of them.  He said that the “Renord-Invest group companies (which acquired the appellants’ assets when the Bank’s security was enforced) were in reality almost certainly owned or controlled by the respondents”.  At [1635(6)], he said, as was obviously the case, that it was extraordinary that not a single independent person participated in any of the auctions, so that but for a limitation period the auctions would likely have been held invalid. </p>

He said that the fact that the circumstances in which the respondents were able to and did call upon the police and regional authorities to assist them take possession of Western Terminal “smacked of intimidation and abuse of position”.  Yet, at [1135]-[1138], the judge had simply said that there were “clear signs that the [respondents] enjoyed an unusual ability to call on state resources and assistance at the local level to reinforce the exercise of their legal rights”, and that it did not “irresistibly follow … that all this was done to advance a preconceived plan to ‘raid’ Dr Arkhangelsky’s businesses without regard to legal right”.  However unsettling the judge found it at [1138], it did not implicate the participants in a conspiracy.  It is hard, I think, to square that conclusion with the judge’s later suggestion of intimidation and abuse of position. </p>

At [1131]-[1133], however, the judge had concluded that the expert evidence of such raids in the Russian Federation, whilst useful, was of limited assistance because (obviously) each case had to be assessed on its own facts.  He did not think that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the necessary premeditation in December 2008/January 2009, when the repo arrangements were made, finding the absence of an agreed moratorium crucial, if not determinative.  The judge did not, however, consider again, in the same context, whether the necessary evidence of predetermination existed at any later stage.  Moreover, his suspicion about the disconcerting echoes of a state-orchestrated raid might have been reinforced by the later events including the “chorus of plainly false evidence” in the Morskoy loan proceedings, the deployment of a police-assisted force to take physical possession of Western Terminal, and the unmarketed auctions at which only companies controlled by the respondents or “loyal friends” were bidding. </p>

A judge’s tardiness in completing his judicial task after a trial is over denies justice to the winning party during the period of the delay. It also undermines the loser’s confidence in the correctness of the decision when it is eventually delivered. Litigation causes quite enough stress, as it is, for people to have to endure while a trial is going on. Compelling them to await judgment for an indefinitely extended period after the trial is over will only serve to prolong their anxiety, and may well increase it. Conduct like this weakens public confidence in the whole judicial process. Left unchecked it would be ultimately subversive of the rule of law. Delays on this scale cannot and will not be tolerated.

Because of the delay in giving judgment, it has been incumbent on us to look with especial care at any finding of fact which is now challenged. In ordinary circumstances where there is a conflict of evidence a judge who has seen and heard the witnesses has an advantage, denied to an appellate court, which is likely to prove decisive on an appeal unless it can be shown that he failed to use, or misused, this advantage. We do not lose sight of the fact that the judge had transcripts of the evidence, as well as very extensive written submissions from counsel. But the very fact of the huge delay in itself weakened the judge’s advantage, and this consideration had to be taken into account when we reviewed the material which was before the judge. In a case as complex as this, it is not uncommon for a judge to form an initial impression of the likely result at the end of the evidence, but when he has come to study the evidence (both oral and written) and the submissions he has received with greater care, he will then go back to consider the effect the witnesses made on him when they gave evidence about the matters that are now troubling him. At a distance of 20 months, Harman J. denied himself the opportunity of making this further check in any meaningful way. …” </p>

Arden LJ emphasised at [7] that “[a]s in any appeal on fact, the court has to ask whether the judge was plainly wrong”, but said that, in the case of a seriously delayed judgment, if the reviewing court found that the judge’s recollection of the evidence was at fault on any material point, then (unless the error could not be due to the delay) it would order a retrial if it could not be satisfied that the judge came to the right conclusion.  That approach has no application in this case, where the judge meticulously re-read all the transcripts.

Instead, he undertook a minute, indeed commendable, analysis of the evidence on each separate point.  The delay may, however, I think, have meant that he was less able to deal with findings he made in the round, perhaps because the findings on one part of the case were made at such a remove in time from other findings. </p>

In assessing whether the public interest would be harmed in that way, it is necessary (a) to consider the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim, (b) to consider any other relevant public policy on which the denial of the claim may have an impact and (c) to consider whether denial of the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality, bearing in mind that punishment is a matter for the criminal courts. Within that framework, various factors may be relevant, but it would be a mistake to suggest that the court is free to decide a case in an undisciplined way. The public interest is best served by a principled and transparent assessment of the considerations identified, rather by than the application of a formal approach capable of producing results which may appear arbitrary, unjust or disproportionate”. </p>

Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 84, [2018] 1 WLR 2777 the Court of Appeal (Vos C, with whom Gloster and McCombe LJJ agreed)  suggested at [65] that “an appellate court should not interfere [in a lower court’s decision on illegality under <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v.

The test involves balancing multiple policy considerations and applying a proportionality approach.

It was said that, without such corrupt payments, the value of Dr Arkhangelsky’s businesses and real estate could not be maintained.  Before us, the respondents contended that the judge had failed to apply <span style="font-style:italic">Patel v. Mirza</span> correctly.  They criticised his reasoning at [1544]-[1546] to the effect that it would be rare for the court to “refuse a person the opportunity to vindicate a right on the grounds that the integrity of the system may thereby be imperilled”.  The judge pointed out that that the respondents were contending that the appellants should be prevented from vindicating their rights in respect of dishonest dealings with their property, when their property was not obtained illegally.  On that basis, the judge said that “by reference to the factors adumbrated illustratively by Lord Toulson, this case seems to me some distance from an appropriate case in which to deprive the [appellants] and insulate the [respondents] in the name of preserving the integrity of the judicial process”.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

That is one of the concerns of inconsistency expressed above.  The same applies to the rationale and true objectives of the transfers of shares in Scan from the Original Purchasers to the Subsequent Purchasers, the removal of Dr Arkhangelsky and Mr Vinarsky, the conduct of the wars in the Russian courts, the transactions relating to the assets of Western Terminal and Scan, such as the Gunard Lease, the unlawful seizure of control of Scan and Western Terminal, the allegedly relentless campaign against Dr Arkhangelsky, the Bank’s conduct of the Morskoy Bank loan proceedings, and the allegedly tell-tale signs of a classic raid.  On these matters, I do not see that it could or should be open to the parties to call any further evidence (subject to something I say below at [104]).

As mentioned above, only the third alternative form of the conspiracy survives intact, but the appellants say that the difference is only a question of the (very uncertain) date on which an agreement to use dishonest means to harm the appellants was made.   In my judgment, the appellants should be at liberty to argue that inferences as to an actionable conspiracy should be drawn from all the facts that the judge found, with the exception of those relating to the forgery and the moratorium.  It is always impossible for a claimant to assert with any certainty when such a conspiracy began.  The claimant cannot know, and the defendant is unlikely to say.  The situation is the same here, and the respondents sought, I think, to make rather too much of the disparity between the alleged forms of the conspiracy.

The trial involved hotly contested and wideranging issues of fact, affecting both claim and counterclaim, with dishonest factual evidence adduced by both parties. The expert valuation evidence was also partisan and unsatisfactory. The appellants’ counterclaim alleged a state-sponsored conspiracy to “raid” their assets which involved extensive forgery of documents, unlawful pressure to enter into the repo arrangements, the Bank’s reneging on an agreed moratorium in order to engineer a default, and the seizure of valuable assets. All this was said to result in a claim for “business loss” amounting to some US $467 million. The judge has demonstrated, in findings which are not challenged, that this version of the conspiracy alleged was untenable and that the damages claimed, resting as they did on the false assertion that the appellants would have been able to borrow funds to discharge their loans to the Bank and develop their business, were far-fetched. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This version of the conspiracy involves allegations of dishonesty by the Bank in what was otherwise the lawful enforcement of its contractual rights. It is accepted that, if established, these allegations would found a valid claim for damages under Article 1064 of the Russian Civil Code. The essence of this version of the conspiracy is that, as a result of the Bank’s dishonesty, the assets pledged to the Bank were sold fraudulently to connected parties for less than their proper market value. Consequently, in order to establish “harm” within the meaning of Article 1064, it was necessary for the appellants to prove both dishonesty on the part of the Bank and also that the sums realised at auction were less than the market value of the assets. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.60in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I have described this as a more modest version of the conspiracy for two reasons. First, the area of factual dispute or, more accurately, the dispute as to the inferences which should be drawn from the facts found by the judge, is much more circumscribed than was the appellants’ primary case. Second, the loss claimed, although significant, is on any view much less than the “business loss” claim. The appellants’ valuation expert, Ms Simonova, put the combined value of the Western Terminal and the Onega Terminal at US $244 million, while the Bank’s expert, Mr Millard, put it at only US $25 million, less than the amounts achieved at auction (see [1434] and [1435]). The evidence of both experts was rejected by the judge as unreliable, but the figures indicate at least the range of the dispute. Ms Simonova’s figures, in particular, were described by the judge as being based on “bold and optimistic assumptions”, containing “obvious flaws” and being highly sensitive to even minor adjustments to her assumptions (see e.g. [1436(2)], [1449] and [1451]). It seems unlikely, therefore, that the true value of these assets was anything close to the figures which she advanced. If that is so, the appellants’ real claim (if they have one at all) is likely to be much lower than they would accept. </p>

There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children it would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one’s reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.” 119.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>Lady Hale said: </p>

He used strong words, such as “extraordinary”, “arresting” and “ruthless” to describe the Bank’s conduct. But he appears to have treated the maxim that “the more serious the allegation … the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur” which he took from Lord Nicholls’ speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Minors)</span> as if it were a rule of law, without regard to the qualification expressed by Lord Nicholls himself and explained more fully in <span style="font-style:italic">In re B (Children).</span> Nor, so far as I can see, did the judge ever ask himself whether, in the light of the facts which he found to be proved and the dishonest evidence which he had heard, the dishonesty alleged against the Bank in the realisation of the assets remained “inherently improbable”.

The list at [1635] of the features which had “encouraged and fomented” his misgivings gives the strong impression that despite his findings made (as he put it) “on the basis of the available evidence, having regard to the burden of proof”, the judge was in reality unconvinced by his own judgment. </p>

Moreover, he continued to have a perception that the Bank had profited from the opportunistic and ruthless pursuit of its commercial objectives ([1635(7)]), procuring for its associates “assets of far greater value than they have accounted for” ([1635(9)]).

Thus it ensured that the assets were sold in unattractive packages with minimal if any marketing (which was not unlawful under Russian law, but was at least surprising, indicating as it does no interest on the part of the Bank in maximising its recovery) ([1525(5)]); it deliberately misled the Russian court by concealing the true nature of a “contrived” and “preconceived” plan to obtain the court’s blessing for an auction sale of the Western Terminal assets at a greatly reduced valuation ([1372] </p>

All this begs the question, why did the Bank go to so much trouble if the assets were indeed of so little value that no independent interest was to be expected?
