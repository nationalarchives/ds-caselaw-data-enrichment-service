He is correct in stating that the terms and conditions of his mortgage characterised the costs of the Court of Appeal as a mortgage debt. As a result those costs should be added to the mortgage debt. That said, I find that the mortgage debt or elements of the mortgage debt remain once the mortgage was released in November 2018. Clearly, the mortgage had to be released to effect the sale of the property. In reality, to my mind the mortgage debt includes costs, those costs remain to be discharged by Mr and Mrs Evans.” </p>

In their witness statement in support of the application, the Appellants expanded on this relief. They wished the court to add to the Costs Order the words “but permanently stayed following the Respondent discharge and reissue by deed of their 95% costs of the appeal”. They also sought an order for the repayment of the sum of £30,000 paid on account of costs. The Respondent filed a witness statement in opposition to the application. </p>

First, the Appellants were advancing the same submission as had been made to, and rejected by, Master Haworth, and any challenge should be way of appeal against his order. Second, and in any event, I stated that I would have refused the application on its merits because “it is clear that the redemption of the charge and the cancellation of the Land Registry entries in respect of it did not have the effect of releasing the applicants from such part of their liabilities secured by the charge as was not paid on redemption of the charge. Any shortfall remained payable to the respondent.” </p>

First, the effect of the discharge of the mortgage on the sale of the property was also to discharge the Appellants from all personal liability for any debt or liability that fell within the definition of mortgage debt and was therefore secured by the mortgage. Second, the Costs Liability was in any event time-barred under section 20 of the Limitation Act 1980. Further, the Appellants were not seeking the same relief from this court as they had sought by the Set Aside Application nor were the grounds advanced in support of the applications the same, so that the application for a stay to this court was not an abuse of process. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The first submission, that discharge of the mortgage discharges personal liability for all debts secured by the mortgage, rests on a misapprehension. There is a fundamental distinction between a personal obligation to pay a debt or other liability and any security (by way of mortgage, charge or otherwise) for that obligation. If the property is sold and the security is thereby realised, the payment of the net proceeds of sale to the mortgagee will reduce the debt owed by the debtor but it will not release the personal obligation of the debtor in respect of any unpaid part of the debt or liability. This has long been the law and it was restated by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Bristol and West plc v </span></p>

In ordinary day-to-day language, people often speak of taking out a mortgage to buy a house or a flat, but this is inaccurate in terms of legal analysis. It is the loan that goes towards paying for the house. The borrower is personally liable to repay the loan and interest on it, while the mortgage on the house provides security for the borrower’s liability. The liability of the borrower is separate from the mortgage of the house, although the personal covenant to repay the loan and pay the interest may be contained in the mortgage document. Unless the debt is fully paid out of the proceeds of the mortgaged property, the discharge of the mortgage will not discharge liability for the unpaid part of the debt.  </p>

He submitted that it required additional express words to make it a personal liability of the Appellants. This submission is unsustainable. By the order dated 17 July 2017, this court made an entirely conventional order for the Appellants to pay 95% of the Respondent’s costs of the appeal, to be assessed on the standard basis. Without more, it imposed a personal liability on the Appellants. It would have required express words to confine the effect of the order in the way suggested by Mr Evans.  </p>

It did not seek from Judge Jarman an order for the costs of the action. Its counsel told the judge that it was relying on its contractual right under the mortgage to treat its costs, which would not therefore be subject to assessment on a standard basis, as secured by the mortgage. In the absence of a personal covenant in the mortgage or elsewhere by the Appellants to pay such costs, they would be recoverable only from the proceeds of its security and not from the Appellants personally. By contrast, the Respondent sought and obtained from this court the Costs Order against the Appellants, by virtue of which they are personally liable for the costs, assessed on the standard basis.  </p>

That period ended in 2016, and the Costs Order was not made until July 2017, but Mr Evans was not deflected from his submission by the consideration that, if he were right, the Costs Liability was timebarred before it existed. Mr Evans’ submission misinterprets the closing words of section 20. The period of 12 years is calculated “from the date on which <span style="font-style:italic">the right to </span></p>
