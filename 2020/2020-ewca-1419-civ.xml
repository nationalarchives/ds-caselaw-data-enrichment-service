	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Companies carrying on “oil-related activities” are subject to both corporation tax and a “supplementary charge”. “Oil-related activities” include extracting, or causing to be extracted, oil at any place in the United Kingdom or on the UK Continental Shelf, transporting any such oil and effecting the initial treatment of any such oil (see sections 272 and 274 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010). Such activities are treated as a separate trade and the income from them represents “ring fence profits” on which corporation tax is charged (see sections 275, 276, 277 and 279 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010). The “supplementary charge” is levied on “adjusted” ring fence profits, in calculating which financing costs are left out of account (see section 330 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010). </p>

On 23 March 2011, however, it was announced that the supplementary charge would be increased to 32% from midnight. The change in rate was subsequently carried into effect by section 7 of the Finance Act 2011, which received the royal assent on 19 July 2011. </p>

The question raised by this appeal is how much of each company’s adjusted ring fence profits for 2011 are liable to the charge at 20% and how much at 32%. Both companies had an accounting period which ran from 1 January to 31 December 2011 and so straddled the point at which the supplementary charge was raised. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In contrast, Mr Michael Jones, who appeared for HMRC, supported the UT’s decision. The distinction drawn by the UT, he said, was between factors which produce the sorts of variations in profits generally experienced by all companies within the scope of the supplementary charge and those factors which could be said to lie outside that range. The flaws in the Companies’ case, he submitted, are revealed by a consideration of four factors in particular. First, the focus of section 7 of the 2011 Act is on the “<span style="font-style:italic">apportionment</span>”<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>of the adjusted ring fence profits of a straddling period. The treatment of the single period as two does not apply for all purposes and, more specifically, it does not apply for the purposes of computing, or re-computing, the profits in question. Secondly, Parliament intended time apportionment to be the default method of apportionment for all companies within the scope of the supplementary charge. Thirdly, the fact that departure from time apportionment is permissible only where it would work unjustly or unreasonably “<span style="font-style:italic">in the company’s case</span>” shows that the injustice or unreasonableness must arise by reason of matters concerning the particular taxpayer in question. Fourthly, there is a distinct absence from section 7 of any direction that some “comparator” basis must be used in order to determine whether a given basis of apportionment is just and reasonable. The true position, Mr Jones argued, is that the exercise of determining whether a proposed alternative basis of apportionment is just and reasonable does not require a comparator as such. What it instead requires is an assessment of the outcome of the proposed method in the context of the relevant circumstances of the company in question.

The UT considered that “in the ordinary course time apportionment is just and reasonable even where profits are not smooth” (paragraph 61 of the decision). For section 7(5) to be engaged, profits in a Later Period must, in the UT’s view, have been depressed by something out of the ordinary, and an alternative basis of apportionment must do no more than compensate for the effect of that unusual event. Further, various passages in the decision suggest a requirement that, for a factor to be capable of engaging section 7(5) or being the subject of an alternative basis of apportionment, it must be unique to the company in question. Thus, the UT said that “factors which affect companies generally … would not be expected to make time apportionment unjust or unreasonable” and that “it is factors which are specific to the company which must cause s 7(5) to be engaged rather than factors which affect all companies in the same or a similar way” (paragraphs 47 and 59). </p>

It observed, moreover, that time apportionment “was intended to be the default position” and that Parliament “intended an apportionment of the profits for the whole period” and “did not intend there to be a recalculation of profits for the Earlier Period and the Later Period” (see paragraphs 45 and 47). </p>

The words can also, however, be read as indicating no more than that the focus is on the circumstances of the company in question, be they unique to that company or such as to affect other companies as well. If, moreover, Parliament had intended matters shared with other companies to be disregarded, it could be expected to have spelt that out, and it has not. On top of that, it is very difficult to see why Parliament should have wished section 7(5) to apply only in relation to matters which did not pertain to other companies. Suppose, for example, that a dramatic fall in the oil price in late March 2011 had had the consequence that oil companies generally had incurred losses in the ensuing period. If one such company had sought to make an election under section 7(5), on the basis that all its profits for the straddling period had been generated before 24 March 2011, there is, on the face of it, no reason why Parliament should have intended such an election to be impermissible because other companies had been affected similarly. </p>

The overall objective is, of course, to apportion the profits of a complete accounting period. The sum of the profits/losses attributed to the Earlier Period and those attributed to the Later Period must equate to the profits for the full accounting period. There may very well, depending on the facts, be more than one way of undertaking the exercise. There is no obvious reason, however, for there to be a bar on allocating the profits earned in the whole accounting period by reference to “actual” performance in the Earlier Period and Later Periods. Such an exercise should both produce figures which, when aggregated, match the profit for the entire accounting period and provide an intelligible basis for determining how that profit should be apportioned between the Earlier and Later Periods. </p>

As, however, Mr Jones accepted, the mere fact that profits for the Earlier Period are given as greater than those for the entire accounting period does not of itself imply any error. Take again the hypothetical drop in the oil price in late March 2011. That might have meant that, by any measure, a company was profitable in the Earlier Period and loss-making in the Later Period. In such circumstances, the profit for the Earlier Period would have been more than 100% of the profits for the year and the appropriate course would necessarily have been to allocate all the adjusted ring fence profits to the Earlier Period. </p>

I do not see, however, that the fact that time apportionment represented the default position says anything important about when a company could elect for a different basis of apportionment. At most, it might be inferred that something of more than minimal significance was needed to justify departure from time apportionment. The existence of the default position is, as it seems to me, of no real assistance in determining whether, as the UT thought, section 7(5) demands something out of the ordinary and/or not shared by other companies. It does not carry any implication that a company which has been less profitable in the Later Period as a result of an exceptional event should be able to opt for a basis other than time apportionment but that one that has been less profitable because of, say, routine shut ins should not. The legislation gives companies subject to the supplementary charge the right to choose an alternative basis where time apportionment would work “unjustly or unreasonably”, and the fact that there is a default position does not assist with when that requirement will be satisfied. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Jones pointed out that, under section 93 of the 2002 Act, sections 501A and 501B of the Taxes Act 1988 were to apply as regards a straddling period “as if so much of the straddling period as falls before 17th April 2002, and so much of that period as falls on or after that date, were separate accounting periods”. Adjusted ring fence profits were thus to be calculated separately for the period from 17 April 2002. In contrast, section 7 of the 2011 Act provides for time apportionment to apply as the default position notwithstanding section 7(4)’s reference to the periods before and from 24 March 2011 being “treated as separate accounting periods”. The difference, Mr Jones suggested, is significant. I do not myself, however, regard it as informative. The distinctions between the provisions simply reflect the fact that, in 2011, Parliament decided that time apportionment should apply unless a company chose otherwise pursuant to section 7(5). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in">“was plainly intended to mitigate the effect of what might be described as retrospective taxation” (paragraph 37 of its decision). That must be right, but, contrary to the UT’s conclusion, it seems to me to suggest that the availability of the election should not depend on there having been something out of the ordinary and/or not shared by other companies. If a company made a disproportionate share of its profits for the straddling period in the Earlier Period as a result of something routine (shut ins, say) rather than an exceptional event, it could still justifiably complain of retrospective taxation if profits were apportioned in accordance with section 7(4). Time apportionment would have the consequence that some of its pre-24 March 2011 profits were subject to tax at 32% rather than the 20% which prevailed when they were generated. The simple fact is that any company with a straddling period which earned profits at a higher rate before 24 March 2011 than afterwards would find some of its profits from the Earlier Period taxed at 32% if section 7(4) were applied. It makes no difference whether profits in the Later Period are depressed by an unusual event or a routine one. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A further reason for considering that Parliament is unlikely to have intended to restrict section 7(5) to cases where there has been something out of the ordinary and/or not shared by other companies is to be found in the problems of application to which such a requirement would give rise. Suppose that a company’s production in the summer months were usually reduced by a four-week shut in for maintenance work, but the shut in lasted five weeks in 2011. Would that be sufficiently exceptional to allow the company to invoke section 7(5) and, if so, could an alternative basis of apportionment take account of the full loss of production or only a week of it? Suppose that a company suffered storm damage in six years out of ten. Would that fall to be disregarded as routine? Would the position be the same if there were storm damage in (a) four years out of ten or (b) eight years out of ten? Would it make a difference if such damage were particularly severe or, conversely, less serious than in many other years?

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In all the circumstances, Mr Jones’ able submissions notwithstanding, I take a different view from the UT of section 7(5). I do not think the application of section 7(4) could be said to work “unjustly or unreasonably” unless time apportionment would prejudice the company in question to a more than minimal extent. It seems to me, however, that any company which earned profits at a significantly faster rate in the Earlier Period than the Later Period, and so stands to be materially prejudiced by time apportionment, can avail itself of section 7(5). It matters not, in my view, whether the differential profitability arose from the exceptional or the routine. The FTT thought that section 7(5) applies to all companies “whose profits are not smoothly spread throughout the year, but whose profits differ greatly from one part of the year to the other, and who could be disadvantaged by … a change of tax rate part way through an accounting period”. I agree. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A particular bone of contention in the present case is the Companies’ treatment of capital allowances. HMRC maintain that the capital expenditure which the Companies incurred in the Later Period should be spread between the Earlier and Later Periods, the Companies that it was appropriate to allocate it all to the Later Period because such expenditure falls to be taken into account when incurred. In my view, the FTT was amply entitled to consider that the Companies’ approach to capital allowances did not prevent the basis of apportionment which they propounded from being “just and reasonable”. Had the Companies happened to have accounting periods ending on 23 March 2011, their capital expenditure in the remainder of 2011 would undoubtedly have served to reduce the adjusted ring fence profits subject to the 32% rate of supplementary charge: there would have been no question of any of the capital expenditure being relevant to determining the Companies’ profits for the period up to 23 March 2011 or, therefore, of the capital allowances increasing the extent to which their adjusted ring fence profits bore the supplementary charge at 32% rather than 20%. I do not see why a basis of apportionment which produces the same results and reflects the Companies’ entitlement to 100% allowances when capital expenditure is incurred should on that account be other than “just and reasonable”. In fact, the Companies could legitimately complain of retrospective taxation if expenditure which they incurred after 24 March 2011 could, in effect, be used to impose additional tax on the profits which they had already earned by the time the higher rate of supplementary charge was announced on 23 March 2011.  </p>
