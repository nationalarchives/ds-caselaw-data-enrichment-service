On 23 October 2019 the Appellants filed an Appellant’s Notice in this court seeking permission to appeal and seeking an order setting aside the UT’s order as a whole. By order of 3 March 2020 of Lewison LJ the Appellants were granted permission to appeal, limited to the period of disqualification only.  </p>

By order of 25 September 2020 (Dingemans LJ) the Secretary of State for Transport was given permission to intervene in the appeal. Mr Heppinstall lodged written submissions on his behalf and supplemented those submissions at the hearing before us. I am grateful to both counsel for their contributions. </p>

Mr Jones said that he realised that the TC would “take my conviction in a very dim light”; he said he had had no convictions since 2014.

It seems that the Crown did not proceed on a further charge of intention to spend the notes still in his possession.

The Meritrule transport manager, Mr. Mark Warren, gave evidence that Mr. Jones had approached him to become the transport manager in about July 2017.

He was not called to the inquiry on that basis and so the TC did not make a formal disqualification order, but she repeated what she had said at the end of the Black Velvet and Western Greyhound inquiry and warned him that if he applied for an operator's licence he would need to address all the concerns set out in the decision.

Specific attention was drawn to Mr Jones’ undeclared conviction, his links to Black Velvet and Western Greyhound which the TC had found to be a joint enterprise between Mr Jones and a Mr Michael Bishop, his links to the revoked BETC licence, further links to Meritrule and Classic Routemaster licences of which Mr Jones had been found to be de facto director and to the question whether Hireyourtransport.com had been operating public service vehicles without the necessary licence. </p>

Once confronted by CLO on 3 September 2018, he has lied, glossed and scorned without a hint of embarrassment or contrition, including at the hearing. Indeed at the hearing his evidence was so fluid it ebbed and flowed like a river, by way of example paragraph 22(ii), 22(iv) and 22(viii) above. Having taken into account the words, demeanour and conduct of Mr. Jones it is difficult to find any redeeming features. I gave him a number of adjournments during the day to gather his thoughts.

Deciding on the appropriateness of any action is therefore different from the sentencing exercise carried out by the criminal courts. Whilst there may be an element of deterrent effect the discounting of penalties or other sentencing practices are discouraged. Nor is it a matter of just ensuring consistency with other individual cases. The legislation provides no definition of good repute, and so when a traffic commissioner is considering if an individual is of good repute the traffic commissioner can have regard to any matter, but in considering a company's repute the traffic commissioner can have regard to all <span style="font-style:italic">material evidence.  </span>In practice these may amount to the same considerations.</p>

He explained that the TCs do not respond to appeals such as this and that it is left to the Secretary of State to apply to intervene in any suitable case in which matters of principle might arise. It was pointed out in Mr Heppinstall’s written submissions that in <span style="font-style:italic">Coakley &amp; </span>others [2003] Scot CS, Lord Kingsdown in the Court of Session said that the TC has no locus standi to appear in that court, but that the Secretary of State is entitled to appear. For my part, I find the present position about this rather unsatisfactory and I take the view that the UT and this court may well be assisted by representation by some person to put directly the opposite side of the argument to that presented by the appellant in support of an appeal. Since the appeal hearing, the Secretary of State has reminded us of the judicial element of the TCs’ function in these matters as a reason for not being represented on appeals from their decisions. Indeed, that is so. However, for example, in my own experience the Information Commissioner frequently appears by counsel in appeals from her decisions; her role has some similarity to that of a TC in the present type of case.

An order for disqualification can only be made against the operator or a director/equivalent of the corporate body (but not for instance a company secretary) or a transport manager (under different provisions). Disqualification of an operator cannot be imposed without an order for revocation (and can be made following revocation of an interim licence) but an order for disqualification does not necessarily follow revocation. Disqualification is a potentially significant infringement of rights and the Upper Tribunal has indicated that whilst there is no 'additional feature' required to order disqualification it is not a direction which should be routinely ordered. There may be cases in which the seriousness of the operator's conduct is such that a traffic commissioner may properly consider that both revocation and disqualification are necessary for the purposes of enforcing the legislation. The provisions are in general terms, consistent with the concept of deterrence, but assessment of culpability and use of words such as penalty should be avoided. The case law indicates a general principle that at the time the disqualification order is made that the operator cannot be trusted to comply with the regulatory regime and that the objectives of the system, the protection of the public and fairness to other operators, requires that the operator be disqualified. A clear example of this is when an operator fails to attend a public inquiry after an application to adjourn the hearing has been refused. </p>

That section of the document provides no definitive “steer” as to the length of any disqualification period. The directions section appears to be aimed at staff exercising delegated functions. Save for the short passage in paragraph 2 of the letter of 22 October 2020, we were not informed as to the circumstances in which staff members might have to deal with issues of disqualification and in which, therefore, they would have to have regard to para. 100. The TCs cannot be fettered by what appears in para. 100 in making their own decisions in individual cases, but the thinking that appears in the paragraph cannot be put entirely out of mind as part of the relevant background.

The proper question is whether in that context the direction is appropriate in the public interest. The objectives of the system plainly include the operator's adherence to the various requirements of sec 13(5).

This is in addition to the obvious consideration that a direction may be used to provide direct protection to the public against dangers arising from the failure to comply with the basis on which the licence was granted.

Disqualification is not to be seen in the same way as a punishment imposed by a criminal court. One has to be conscious of the disciplinary function arising in this jurisdiction and one must be cautious of expressions such as “serious punishment” in describing the power to disqualify.

The reference in the decision to “the pride taken by the TCs in their role” is merely reflective of a recognition of the need to ensure proper respect by operators for the regulatory function of the TCs and the need to deter those in the industry from the type of deceptive behaviour that the TC found had occurred in this case. The conduct demonstrated a refusal to recognise the need to be subject to oversight or regulation and a determination to earn money notwithstanding avoiding its reach.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">It was suggested in the grant of permission to appeal that this might be a case for the court to give guidance on the principles to be applied. On reflection, I do not think that can be so, given that the statutory power to give guidance on matters of sanction is expressly conferred by PSVA 1981 s.4C(1) and (2), upon the STC, after compliance by him with the wide consultation obligation imposed upon him/her in s.4C(4), and that he has positively declined to prescribe any tariff system. It seems that the STC has left TCs to be guided by the general principles that he has set out in the guidance section of the Statutory Document. However, I would not leave the case without the comment that the role to be played by para. 100 of the Statutory Document seems to me, with respect, worthy of further consideration.  </p>
