Whilst I accept that the AJA falls to be construed on its own terms, I am unable to accept the MND's contention that it does not apply to the registration of foreign judgments on foreign judgments made in civil proceedings whereby a sum of money is payable. The definition of ‘judgment’ provided for in s. 12 of the AJA is very broad and the word ‘any’, in particular, powerfully inclusive. However desirable it might [be] for judgments on judgments not to be registrable under the AJA and for there to be deterrence against the ‘laundering’ of judgments, there is no escaping the clear and express words of s. 12 of the AJA, legislation which, unlike the 1933 Act, has not been amended so as to exclude the registration of judgments on judgments. The words of s. 12 of the AJA do not permit a construction which excludes the registration of the Cayman Default Judgment which was a judgment made by a court in civil proceedings whereby a sum of money was made payable. Professor Briggs does not analyse how they might. If Parliament wishes to exclude a judgment on a judgment from registration under the AJA, it can do so by legislative change, as exemplified by the amendment to the 1933 Act. But as a matter of construction the present words of s. 12 encompass the Cayman Default Judgment and ST was able properly to invoke the AJA.” </p>

The principle on which the 1933 Act is based is the same principle of reciprocity as underpins the 1920 Act. Indeed, it appears from the Greer Committee Report that one driver of the 1933 Act was a concern that the existing position was unbalanced and unfair: whereas foreign judgments could be enforced in England by means of an action on the judgment at common law, there was no equivalent method of enforcing English judgments abroad so that a claimant successful against the foreign defendant “often finds that he has to fight his case over again on the merits in the foreign court” (<span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“The Act of 1920 provided for the registration of a judgment obtained in His Majesty’s Dominions, but  did not deal with foreign judgments.  The heading of the Act of 1920 is: ‘An Act to amend the law with respect to the administration of justice and with respect to the constitution of the Supreme Court, to facilitate the reciprocal enforcement of judgments and awards in the United Kingdom and other parts of His Majesty’s Dominions or Territories under His Majesty’s protection,’ and the heading of Part II of the same statute is: ‘Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments in the United Kingdom and in other parts of His Majesty’s Dominions,’ and did not in any way deal with foreign judgments. It was however fully appreciated by those who thought about foreign judgments, that British judgments were never enforced as of right in foreign countries, and that was believed, and rightly believed, to operate as an injustice to this country. Whereas we enforced foreign judgments by means of action in this country, foreign countries refused to enforce the judgments obtained in this country, and it was to deal with that situation that the statute of 1933 was passed, but incidentally, it also dealt with Dominion judgments. Now it seems to me to be quite clear with regard to s.1 and s.2 of the Act of 1933, that the statute is concerned with the enforcement of foreign judgments and Dominion judgments, where it could be established that there were reciprocal rights in the foreign countries or in the Dominions </p>

This was deliberate and was intended to promote reciprocity. The Greer Committee identified a mistaken but nevertheless real concern on the part of foreign courts that the existing English common law rules for enforcing foreign judgments were largely discretionary and that this made them reluctant to recognise English judgments. </p>

He submitted in particular that the common law does not permit an action to enforce a judgment on a judgment; that at common law the judgment to be enforced must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits of the underlying dispute; and that the 1920 Act should be interpreted as reflecting the position at common law. He submitted in addition that there are clear indications in the 1920 Act itself and in its legislative background to demonstrate that the Act does not permit registration of a judgment on a judgment. Those indications, he submitted, include that it is fundamental to the operation of the Act that the English court should be able to scrutinise the proceedings in the court which gave judgment on the underlying dispute in order to ensure (for example) that this court had jurisdiction; that the Act contemplates only two stages, namely the proceedings in the court leading to a judgment on the merits of the underlying dispute and the proceedings in England for registration of that judgment, and not three stages also involving an intermediate court; and that to interpret the Act as permitting registration of a judgment on a judgment would unbalance the reciprocity on which the Act is based. Mr Onslow relied also on the reports which led to the passing of the 1920 and 1933 Acts and on academic and textbook writings. </p>

He submitted that what matters is the true meaning of the Act and that the common law is irrelevant. The language of the Act, including in particular the definition of “judgment” in section 12, is clear and there is no reason to conclude that Parliament intended to exclude a judgment on a judgment from the registration process. To the extent that registration of a judgment on a judgment might in some circumstances constitute an abuse, for example if the court which gave judgment on the underlying merits did not have jurisdiction, the English court could exercise its discretion under section 9(1) not to permit registration. Alternatively, Mr Reza submitted that, if the common law is relevant, it was sufficient that the Cayman Islands court had jurisdiction because the MND had submitted there, so that the Cayman judgment created an obligation on the MND to pay the judgment sum in accordance with common law principles. </p>

For this purpose he cited <span style="font-style:italic">Nouvion v Freeman</span> (1889) 15 App Cas 1, albeit recognising that this case does not actually decide the point. The first answer which I would give to this submission is that, in truth, the common law has never had to grapple with the question whether such a judgment can be enforced and the reasoning in<span style="font-style:italic"> Nouvion v Freeman</span> does not indicate what answer to that question it would have given. The issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Nouvion v Freeman</span> was whether a Spanish “remate” judgment could be enforced by action at common law when that judgment was essentially provisional, as it was open to the losing party to take “plenary” proceedings in which the merits of the issue would be reconsidered. The House of Lords held that it could not be enforced because such a judgment was not “final and conclusive”. Lord Herschell explained what is meant by saying that the foreign judgment must be “final and conclusive” in these terms (emphasis added): </p>

If it is not conclusive in the same Court which pronounced it, so that notwithstanding such a judgment the existence of the debt may between the same parties be afterwards contested in that Court, and upon proper proceedings being taken and such contest being adjudicated upon, it may be declared that there existed no obligation to pay the debt at all, then I do not think that a judgment which is of that character can be regarded as finally and conclusively evidencing the debt, and so entitling the person who has obtained the judgment to claim a decree from our Courts for the payment of the debt. </p>

In such a case it may well be said that giving credit to the Court of another country we are prepared to take the fact that such adjudication has been made as establishing the existence of the debt or obligation. But where, as in the present case, the adjudication is considered with the non-existence of the debt or obligation which it is sought to enforce, and it may thereafter be declared by the tribunal which pronounced it that there is no obligation and no debt, it appears to me that the very foundation upon which the Courts of this country would proceed in enforcing a foreign judgment altogether fails.” </p>

It is therefore possible to tick off the requirements set out in section 9(2): the Cayman Islands court had jurisdiction to which the MND submitted; the MND was duly served; the Cayman judgment was not obtained by fraud; no appeal from it was pending; and the Cayman judgment was in respect of a cause of action (i.e. the obligation created by the Singapore judgment) which was not contrary to English public policy. </p>

Judgments of foreign courts will only be recognised in the United Kingdom if reciprocal provisions have been made by the legislature of the Commonwealth state in which the judgment was given. That is clear from the terms of the Act itself and is underlined by the Sumner Committee Report which led to its passing. That Report ruled out the idea of simply making a judgment obtained in any part of what was then the British Empire enforceable throughout the Empire and instead proposed a scheme which included what became the safeguards set out in section 9(2). It shows also that although the 1920 Act was to be limited to the Empire, it was seen as a first step towards the making of reciprocal arrangements with foreign countries generally. The essential principle, therefore, was not, as it might have been, one of “mutual trust” between different parts of the Empire, but a principle of reciprocity with safeguards. </p>

It would mean that a judgment given in a state with which no such arrangements existed and which was not even in the Commonwealth (for example, the United States) could in effect be registered for enforcement here by the expedient of an action to enforce that judgment in an intermediate state to which the 1920 Act does apply, an expedient sometimes described somewhat pejoratively as “judgment laundering”. It would not, in my judgment, be a sufficient answer to this possibility to say that such registration might if necessary be refused as a matter of discretion. Parliament cannot have intended the discretion in section 9(1) to deal with that situation. If it had done so, it would have included an equivalent discretion in the 1933 Act which was also, and even more obviously in view of its title, based on reciprocity, or would at least have addressed the issue in some other way. But it did not do so. Nor would it be an answer to say that the defendant need not submit to the jurisdiction of the intermediate court. The defendant might have no choice about that, for example if it had a presence in the state concerned. Moreover, at the time when the 1920 Act was enacted, the statutory protection against being held to have submitted to a foreign jurisdiction contained in section 33 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgment Act 1982 did not exist. </p>

The claimant obtained a default judgment in Nevada which he then entered as a “sister state” judgment in California. He then commenced proceedings in British Columbia seeking registration of the California judgment in accordance with legislation which appears to have been similar in material respects to the 1920 Act. In particular, the definitions of “judgment” and “original court” were materially the same. Reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of judgements existed between British Columbia and California, but not between British Columbia and Nevada. The Court of Appeal held that the California judgment could not be registered for three reasons. The first concerned the nature of the California judgment. It was not a judgment which itself made money payable, but merely made the Nevada judgment enforceable in California, and therefore was not within the statutory definition of “judgment”. The second reason was that there were specific indications in the British Columbia legislation that it did not apply to the registration in an intermediate state of a judgment originally given in a third state. It is the third reason, however, which is presently of interest. This was that to allow the registration of the Nevada judgment would be contrary to the principle of reciprocity. Giving the judgment of the court Tysoe JA said: </p>

To allow the appellant’s judgment to be registered in British Columbia would have the effect of permitting registration of a judgment granted by a court of a nonreciprocating jurisdiction, contrary to the intent of sections 29(1) and 37(1). In my view, the Legislature did not intend to provide for registration in British Columbia of a judgment granted by a court of another jurisdiction by an indirect method it is not permitted to be done directly. Otherwise, when the Lieutenant Governor in Council declared a state to be a reciprocating state, it would have the effect of declaring all of the jurisdictions that are reciprocal to that jurisdiction to also be states reciprocal to British Columbia for the purpose of registering judgements. In the case of declaring California to be a reciprocating state, the Lieutenant Governor in Council would effectively be declaring all other states of the United States of America to be reciprocating states because California permits the entry of sister state judgements issued by a court of any of the states of the United States.” </p>

This confirms that the Act contemplates only two stages, the proceedings in the court leading to a judgment on the merits of the underlying dispute and the proceedings in England for registration of that judgment, and not three stages also involving an intermediate court. I would accept that, literally, it is possible to interpret “the original court” in section 9(2) as referring to an intermediate court whose judgment it is sought to register, so that (in the present case) the question </p>

The fact that, in circumstances where this issue had never arisen at common law, Parliament is unlikely to have had the possibility of enforcement of a judgment on a judgment in mind, suggests that it would have contemplated that the “original court” whose judgment it was sought to register would be the same court which had dealt with the underlying dispute and not an intermediate court such as the Cayman Islands court in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is fundamental to the operation of the Act that the English court should be able to scrutinise the proceedings in the court which gave judgment on the underlying dispute in order to ensure that the conditions for registration are satisfied. This appears most clearly, perhaps, from paragraph (f) of section 9(2), which provides that no judgment shall be registered if “the judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy or for some other similar reason could not have been entertained by the registering court”. This is plainly directed to the underlying cause of action (here, the cause of action in Singapore) and not the distinct but somewhat theoretical cause of action (sued on in the Cayman Islands) to enforce the obligation created by the judgment of the Singapore court. To interpret paragraph (f) as referring to the cause of action in an intermediate court would accord greater substance than is warranted to what Lord Collins described in <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin v Eurofinance SA</span> as the “theoretical and historical basis for the enforcement of foreign judgments at common law”. </p>

If that had been Parliament’s intention, it would have included a discretion to deal with the equivalent safeguards in the 1933 Act. </p>

It suggests at paragraph 14-121 that English law will not treat a judgment on a judgment as final and conclusive on the merits. That is not quite the same as saying that it cannot be registered under the 1920 Act, but in practice it amounts to much the same thing. Three reasons are suggested: </p>

The civil law principle that <span style="font-style:italic">exequatur sur exequatur ne vaut</span> is sometimes used to help explain why a judgment from the third state is not converted into an enforceable judgment by virtue of its recognition or endorsement by another court. Though no English case expressly so holds, the principle is sound for at least three reasons: the effect of the foreign proceedings will often only be to declare the third country judgment to be enforceable or executable within the territory of the foreign court, an order which by its very terms can have no effect in England; the foreign judgment will not usually be on the merits of the claim; and because of the confusion liable to result if both the judgment of the third country and the foreign (enforcement) judgment were to be separately enforceable in England”. </p>

The third point is capable of arising, however, in any case where (for example) interest runs either before or after judgment at different rates in the initial and the intermediate courts and where different costs awards are made in the two jurisdictions.  </p>

The amendment of the 1933 Act is at least consistent with a desire to clarify what the position was already thought to be and does not necessarily represent a change. It is not at all clear why the 1920 Act was not amended at the same time and it is at least possible that this was simply overlooked.

But that, as I have explained, is the basis on which this appeal has proceeded. Mr Reza also made some submissions to the effect that the MND is a judgment debtor whose attempts to evade payment are lacking in merit.
