	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“2.27 Our fourth and final recommendation concerns the service of notices affecting land following the death of the land-owner. There are many situations in dealing with land in which it is necessary for notice to be given to the owner. Examples are: notices to quit land which is let, notices to exercise options to purchase <span style="font-size:11.5pt">or </span>to extend leases and notices to exercise rights to review a rent. Where a notice is required to be served on the land-owner, a notice addressed to the deceased former owner will not be sufficiently served, since the deceased’s property will necessarily have vested in either his personal representatives or, at present, the President of the Family Division of the High Court. In the absence of special statutory <span style="font-size:11.5pt">or </span>contractual provisions, the notice must then be served in the names of the personal representatives (not simply “to the personal representatives” of the deceased) <span style="font-size:11.5pt">or, </span>in a case of intestacy, on the President of the Family Division. (See <span style="font-style:italic">Wirral Borough Council v Smith</span> (1982) 43 P. &amp; C.R. 312.) Problems arise in two circumstances. First, the person wishing to serve the notice may be unaware of the death. Secondly, even if he knows of the death, he may be unable to discover whether there is a will, whether it appoints executors and if so, who they are. In any event, the risk always exists that the will is invalid or has been superseded by a later one. In the absence of a will, he must discover whether letters of administration have been granted. These problems will become critical if the notice has to be served within a strict time-limit. The party wishing to serve the notice may suffer considerable loss by reason of the other’s death. It seems to <span style="font-size:11.5pt">us </span>unjust that the law should not offer a procedure to overcome the consequences of this capricious disruption of the parties’ contractual relations.” </p>

Hackney Borough Council, having let residential premises to a Mr Ronald Pavey, and Mr Pavey having died, and the Council having taken the view that there was no person qualified to succeed Mr Pavey, the Council sought to determine the continuing contractual tenancy. The Council delivered to the premises on 19 December 2014 a document, described in its header as “Notice to Quit”, addressed to “the personal representatives </p>

The Council claimed that the notice to quit determined the tenancy on 18 January 2015. On 24 April 2015 the Council sent a copy of the notice to quit to the Public Trustee, which was apparently received by the Public Trustee that day.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Judge Luba concluded, firstly, that section 18 requires that, in order to take effect, there must be both service of the actual notice at the premises directed to the personal representatives in accordance with section 18(1)(a), and delivery of a copy of it to the Public Trustee in accordance with section 18(1)(b). He held, secondly, that the saving clause in the notice to quit must operate in relation to proper service rather than partial service of the notice to quit, that is to say when the copy was received by the Public Trustee. That meant that the saving clause operated only when the copy had been served on the Public Trustee. If the saving provision in the copy of the notice to quit took effect from that date, the tenancy would have determined on 24 or 25 May 2015. Thirdly, he then sought to apply the principle that a notice to quit must be clear as to the date on which it determines the tenancy, and if a reasonable recipient of the notice cannot determine from it the date on which the tenancy ends or will end, then it fails for want of clarity.  Fourthly, he held that the date of determination of the tenancy had to be clear both to the personal representatives from the original notice, and to the Public Trustee and anyone who may legitimately have an interest in the validity of the notice or otherwise, from the copy. Finally, he concluded that the reasonable recipient of the notice delivered on 19 December 2014 could not possibly have known that the notice would determine the tenancy on 24 or 25 May 2015, and the Public Trustee could not have been certain about the date of determination of the tenancy without also knowing that the original notice had been served at the premises. Accordingly, Judge Luba held that the notice to quit failed on the test of validity for lack of clarity. </p>

It cannot have been envisaged by the Law Commission, or by Parliament in enacting the 1994 Act, that the date for determination of the tenancy could or should be understood to be a different date in the hands of each of the two recipients, ie, the addressees, the personal representatives, and the person to whom a copy was to be sent, the Public Trustee. Thirdly, it is important, particularly in the context of notices intended to determine interests, but also in relation to notices intended to affect interests, that the notices be clear.  … In my judgment it is important that it is clear to that person [the actual tenant who receives it] but it must also be clear to any other person who may legitimately have an interest in the validity of the notice or otherwise. … They all need to know from an examination of the terms of the document itself, with clarity, when it determines the tenancy.” <span style="font-weight:bold">Grounds of appeal </span></p>

He points to clause 1(6) of the lease, quoted above, as being such a term, as it provides that notices shall be validly served on the Tenant if posted or delivered to the Property. At the hearing of the appeal, however, Mr Grundy accepted that Mr Ali died intestate (there being no evidence or pleading that he died testate); and he conceded that this ground of appeal could not therefore succeed on the present facts as the notice to quit was addressed to the personal representatives and, letters of administration not having been granted, there were not any personal representatives in whom the tenancy had vested. </p>

In that context he referred to paragraph 11 of his skeleton argument. It is stated there that there is nothing in the case law or the text books to suggest that landlords have regularly fallen into the difficulties suggested. It is submitted in the skeleton argument that the solution, in any event, would be for the landlord to post the notice and the copy  by first class post at the same time and, absent any proven delay in the postal system, the two notices will be deemed, by virtue of section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, to have arrived at the same time. In the course of oral submissions, Mr Bates accepted that this carried an element of risk for the landlord as the presumption may be rebutted, as indeed it was in the present case on the facts found by the Deputy District Judge (who found that the copy was posted to the Public Trustee on 18 October 2018 but was only received on 30 October 2018). Mr Bates said it was all a question of “risk management” and the degree of risk a landlord was prepared to accept.  He submitted that, if a landlord was not prepared to accept any risk of a discrepancy that the presumption in section 7 might be rebutted, then the landlord should arrange for personal service on the Public Trustee.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There is another difficulty which it is accepted would arise on Judge Luba’s interpretation and application of section 18 of the 1994 Act. It was an essential part of his reasoning that a notice to quit will fail for lack of clarity unless it is possible for the recipient to know on what date the notice will determine the tenancy. On his analysis, as the copy of the notice served on the Public Trustee has contractual effect and the tenancy will only determine if the notices provide for the same date of determination of the tenancy, the notice to quit will only be valid if it makes clear when service of the copy on the Public Trustee will take place. This difficulty was not addressed in <span style="font-style:italic">Pavey</span>. Mr Bates submitted that the difficulty can be overcome by simultaneous service and a covering letter to the personal representatives or an endorsement on the notice informing them that service would be simultaneous, with a similar letter being sent to the Public Trustee on service of the copy.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The starting point for Judge Luba’s reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Pavey</span> is that, in accordance section 18, the notice to quit is only sufficiently served if has been delivered in accordance with section 18(1)(a) and a copy has been served on the Public Trustee in accordance with section 18(1)(b). It is implicit in his judgment that both the service of the notice to quit and the service of the copy are of equal significance and consequence. As he said (at [25]), there can only be the running of time from proper service rather than partial service of the notice to quit. It was from that starting point that he  asserted (in [31]) that it is important that in both notices there is set out the same date for termination of the tenancy, or the same rubric for determining the date, as it cannot have been envisaged by the Law Commission or by Parliament that the date for determination of the tenancy could or should be understood to be a different date in the hands of each of the two recipients, the personal representatives and the Public Trustee. Accordingly, for Judge Luba, the notice to quit and the copy served on the Public Trustee is each a self-standing document, and it must be clear from each of them when the tenancy would be determined, and that must be the same date of determination notwithstanding that the service of the notice and the service of the copy might not be the same date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">With all respect to Judge Luba’s careful analysis, we consider that he has mischaracterised the significance of the copy served on the Public Trustee, and its inter-relationship with the notice to quit. It is fundamental that what is served on the Public Trustee is only a copy of the notice to quit. It is not an independent, selfstanding notice. Mr Bates placed weight on the fact that the Public Trustee is the notional tenant. That cannot, however, be a compelling consideration. In the first place, although the Public Trustee might be the notional tenant in the present case if (as asserted by counsel, but not pleaded) Mr Ali died intestate, the Public Trustee will not be the notional tenant where the tenant died testate and there are executors capable of taking a grant of probate. In the second place, section 18(1)(b) requires the copy to be addressed, not to the Public Trustee, but to the personal representatives. Accordingly, I do not agree with the submission of Mr Bates that what is to be served under section 18(1)(b) of the 1994 Act is not a copy of the notice to quit but, in his words, a notice “of the same form and of the same effect” as the notice to quit under section 18(1)(a). The operative document is the notice to quit and its terms govern the date of determination of the tenancy. The date on which the service of that document is deemed to be served, pursuant to section 18(1), is a different issue. </p>

On Judge Luba’s analysis, however, that is a crucial date for establishing the termination of the tenancy and the validity of the notice to quit. The evidence before us of the usual practice of the Public Trustee in relation to the recording of the date of applications for registration, which would be accompanied by a copy of the notice to quit, was exiguous. Regulation 3(2) of the 1995 Regulations is quite clear, however, that the only date to be recorded on the register kept by the Public Trustee is “the date on which the entry on the register was made”. Regulation 3(2) provides for an application for registration to be made in Form NL(1). Paragraph 5 of the explanatory notes to that document states that: “The date and description of Notices are requested for office purposes only and will not be entered on the register”.  No change to these matters was made by subsequent regulations. </p>

Judge Luba stated (at [31]) that the notice to quit needs to be clear to any person who may legitimately have an interest in the validity of the notice or otherwise. Section 19(3)(c) of the 1994 Act contemplated that regulations might provide not merely for the personal representatives and those interested in the deceased’s estate to be supplied with copies of documents served on the Public Trustee but “any person”. That is, indeed, the effect of regulation 4 of the 1995 Regulations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Looking at the Law Commission’s report more generally, we agree with the submission of Mr Grundy that the primary focus of the Law Commission was on the difficulties of owners of land being able to serve notices following the death of the person who would otherwise have been the recipient. That is clear from paragraph 2.27 of the report, quoted above, and from the earlier description of the scope of the Commission’s recommendations, in paragraph 1.9(d) of the report, as follows:   </p>

Rights and liabilities in relation to land are frequently regulated or triggered by the service of notices. Difficulties arise when they cannot be properly served for one of two reasons: first, the person serving the notice does not know the intended recipient has died; or, secondly, although he knows of the death, he does not know, and cannot find out, whether there are any personal representatives or who they are. It seems unjust that these circumstances should preclude the service of any notice. We have however devised a procedure that will not unreasonably prejudice the deceased’s estate.” </p>

Moreover, the record required to be kept by the Public Trustee, although far from comprehensive, still performs a useful function. The right to call for copies of the documents will be sufficient to alert those investigating to the fact that notices have been served in relation to the property, further details of which can then be obtained by enquiries of those who served the notices. </p>

That is wholly unpredictable date, which could be years in the waiting if, for example the will, the executors appointed by the will or for some other reason the grant of probate is challenged. Mr Grundy described that period of waiting, in the case of a tenancy, as a “twilight” period when the landlord cannot enforce the terms of the tenancy.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Furthermore, in many cases the date of service of notices is critical for the timing of notices and counternotices. Although the point was not elaborated before us by counsel, section 18 on its face applies to any notice affecting land, whether served by the owner, a tenant or a third party. In the case, for example of business tenancies, rent review notices and notices to treat under compulsory purchase legislation, to name but a few examples, there are time limits on the service of notices and counternotices, and the person affected may not be the person who has the responsibility under section 18 for serving the copy notice under section 18(1)(b). It is not consistent with the objectives of the Law Commission’s recommendation or of Parliament in enacting section 18 for there to be such a potentially long and uncertain period of delay before effective and valid service. </p>
