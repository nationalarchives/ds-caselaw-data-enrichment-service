The interim injunction was sought by the first claimant and appellant, Neurim Pharmaceuticals (1991) Limited (“Neurim”), and its registered exclusive licensee, the second claimant and appellant, Flynn Pharma Limited (“Flynn”).  Neurim and Flynn allege that the defendants and respondents, Generics UK Limited (trading as Mylan) and Mylan UK Healthcare Limited (together “Mylan”), threaten and intend to infringe Neurim’s patent, EP(UK) 1,441,702 B1 (“the patent”).   </p>

Circadin is Flynn’s “flagship product” and one of 15 products that Flynn has in its portfolio.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Circadin is in Category C in the NHS Drug Tariff.  The significance of that categorisation is that the reimbursement price to pharmacists is set based on the branded product, i.e. Circadin. Category C lists drugs that are not readily available as a generic.  When generic competitors become available the drug can be re-categorised into Category A or M.  Category A is for drugs that are readily available, and the price is calculated from a basket of suppliers.  Category M lists drugs that are readily available and the price is calculated by the Department of Health and Social Care on the basis of information submitted by manufacturers.  A decision to move a drug from Category C to Category A or M is taken by the Secretary of State following a consultation process.    </p>

First, it would cause them to lose sales of Circadin and depress the price at which they could continue to make such sales as they were able to retain.  I will refer to this head as “pecuniary loss”.  Secondly, they said that the loss of revenue from sales of Circadin would cause consequential damage to their businesses in a variety of ways.  They said that the lost revenues would create a need to close down research and development (including clinical trials) and educational programmes, cause them to make redundancies, have an impact on the market for Slenyto and other fledgling products and harm their distribution networks. I will refer to this aspect of their damage as “consequential loss”. </p>

This is a familiar point taken in interim injunction cases in this industry. Whilst it is recognised that the entry of a first generic competitor may be at a price not far below that of the branded product, much fiercer price competition can be contemplated where two or more generic manufacturers are competing with each other on price.  The price will accordingly be driven down faster and further.  Whether a price spiral will occur in the period until trial in any given case is intensely fact sensitive.  </p>

Mylan also contended that such lost revenue as Neurim and Flynn would sustain would not result in any consequential loss, because Neurim and Flynn had cash reserves which could be deployed to maintain all the identified activities despite the loss in revenue.  By contrast, by losing the opportunity to launch a product in pursuance of their marketing authorisation in a period without other generic competitors, they would lose the valuable first mover advantage, when the price would be significantly higher than the price when multiple generic competitors had launched their competing products.    </p>

The boundary between the adequate and the inadequate is not a precise one.  It is a matter for judicial evaluation on the evidence in any given case whether or not the boundary is crossed.  If it is not crossed in relation to the claimant’s loss then, normally, an injunction will not be granted. </p>

		<p class="footnotedescription"><span> </span>There was an attempt by Neurim and Flynn to contend that the damage would continue beyond expiry of the patent, but it does not appear that this was a point argued below.

The first, which he called Period 1, was the period between the hearing and the point at which Neurim and Flynn succeeded in excluding Mylan from the market by obtaining a permanent injunction after trial.  During this period Circadin and Slenyto would be exposed to generic competition.  The second period, which he called Period 2, was the period between that point and the expiry of the patent, during which period Neurim and Flynn argued that they would continue to suffer harm from the downward pressure on prices encountered in Period 1.  Mylan contended that in the 20 months or so between trial and the expiry of the patent Neurim and Flynn would be able to restore the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo ante</span>.

The judge found this point “by no means straightforward” and concluded that this was “an irrelevant factor”.  It is the subject of Mylan’s respondent’s notice on this appeal.  On the second point, Mylan’s contention was that sales of Circadin for its patented use accounted for only 2% of prescriptions. In the light of the conflicting evidence on this issue the judge concluded that he could not resolve the quantity of sales falling within each of the Medical Uses which he had identified (see paragraph 6 above).  He concluded that this point did not assist Mylan, in any event, because Neurim and Flynn could contend that the losses flowing from Mylan’s infringements in the case of Medical Uses 1 and 2 could arguably include Medical Use 3.

Period 2 is actually very limited in duration – Periods 1 and 2 <span style="text-decoration:underline">together</span> amount to just over two years – and, as I have noted, there will be considerable market data in the hands of Neurim, Flynn and Mylan to enable the losses in Periods 1 and 2 to be quantified.” </p>

Thus, were an interim injunction to be granted, but the Patent to be invalidated at trial, Mylan would lose its advantage and start on an equal footing with its rivals.

As I have said, the critical issue for the judge, and the finding which he made which was fatal to the interim injunction application, was whether the remedy in damages was adequate for Neurim and Flynn, but no attempt is made to differentiate the grounds according to their relevance to the issues.  I agree with Mr Vanhegan QC for Mylan that grounds 1 to 4 are relevant to the adequacy of damages to Neurim and Flynn.  Grounds 5 to 9 appear to be an attack on the components of a finding which the judge did not make, namely that the balance of convenience favoured the refusal of the injunction.  Ground 10 appears to be potentially relevant to adequacy of damages as well. </p>

The deponents were therefore giving their evidence on the footing that, if no interim injunction were granted, there could be a lengthy period of generic competition, of the order of 1 to 2 years, before the trial of the action and the grant of a permanent injunction.  Such a period would indeed deprive Neurim and Flynn of a large part of the remaining monopoly under the patent.  Thus, by way of example only, Professor Nava Zisapel, the Chief Scientific Officer and Managing Director of Neurim (and the inventor of the patent in suit) gives evidence at paragraph 5.2 of her first witness statement that “If a generic were to launch now in the UK, the price of Circadin is expected to collapse, in which event Neurim will lose a very substantial portion of the UK income it has forecast over the next two and a half years.”   At the time she gave that evidence it must have been expected that a trial would be at some distance in the future, depriving Neurim of protection for a substantial part of the remaining life of the patent.  It cannot be assumed that a short period of generic competition followed by a final injunction would have the same effect.   </p>

That is a very short timescale for the dramatic price effects foreseen by Flynn to take place.  53% of Flynn’s market is presently branded prescriptions which are protected from generic competition, and Flynn could be expected to retain a portion of the rest.  Circadin is in Category C in the NHS Drug Tariff which means that the list price will remain the same until it is moved to Category M.    But there was evidence from Dr Amanda Britton, Commercial Director of the second respondent, that the changes to the Drug Tariff Category are slow, with the consequence that Flynn can maintain its list price for some time.  On the basis of her experience, she did not think that Circadin would be moved to Category M before trial. That evidence chimes with the evidence about the process of re-categorisation on the Drug Tariff, which seems likely to involve some delay. </p>

It would, as he put it, be flogging a dead horse in the sense that the investment would be being made for the benefit of the generic competitors.  I was wholly unpersuaded by this.  Firstly, the fact that Circadin has been exposed to a short period of competition from one generic company before the competitor is excluded from the market by injunction cannot be equated with Circadin “becoming generic”.  Secondly, that argument provides no rationale for not continuing to fund research into new products.  Thirdly, I see no reason why the investment in Circadin, if worthwhile for the two years remaining of the patent’s life, becomes pointless if the period of exclusivity is reduced by 4 months, and the reduction in expected revenue is replaced by an award of damages.  </p>

Comparisons with other cases for this purpose usually reveal differences on the facts which render them unhelpful.  A number of features of the present case, in my judgment, make the court’s task in assessing the loss to Neurim and Flynn relatively straightforward.  First, and most importantly, Neurim and Flynn have, and have provided to the court, reasonably detailed forecasts of their expected sales revenues in Periods 1 and 2.  These can form the basis of the court’s calculation of the position which Neurim and Flynn ought to have been in, but for Mylan’s infringement, for both Periods. The object of the  inquiry as to damages will be to restore their revenues to those levels.  Secondly, in respect of Period 1, the court will have Flynn’s and Mylan’s actual sales figures and the prices at which they have sold.  This can form the basis for the lost sales and price depression claim for Period 1, and I see no reason to suppose that this will be inadequate.   </p>

The court will, however, know what this price is.  During this period Circadin will not be exposed to generic competition, and to that extent the monopoly will be restored, albeit that it will no longer be possible to charge the monopoly price, because the court is likely to accept the evidence that it will not be possible to raise the Circadin price to its former levels without loss of customer goodwill.  I agree with the judge that the calculation for Period 2 will require an extrapolation to determine Flynn’s  likely sales and prices in Period 2, and to that extent it will be marginally less robust.  Damages are, however, to be “assessed liberally” without going so far as to punish the infringer: see <span style="font-style:italic">Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Puncture Proof Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd </span>(1899) 16 R.P.C. 209 at 215.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would, however, comment briefly on some points in the judge’s reasoning which were ventilated at the hearing but which are, in the event, immaterial.  First, in paragraph 79, he said that a second competitor would cause the sales and price of Circadin to diminish “to a similar extent as if there were only a single competitor”.  The evidence of Dr Fakes was that a first competitor might reduce the price by 3040% and a second competitor by 70-80%.  Read literally therefore, each competitor could be seen as contributing a similar extent of price depression.  As Dr Fakes went on to explain, however, the entry of a second or subsequent generic causes the price reduction to become “more rapid and unpredictable (often called a “price spiral”).”  In the light of my conclusion that this is not a price spiral case, this does not matter.  Secondly, in the same paragraph the judge goes on to discuss the contribution to the damages caused by different infringers.  This does not seem to me to have any bearing on the calculation of the total loss sustained by Neurim and Flynn, or render the computation of that sum more difficult in a relevant way.  To that extent I think that the judge may have over-estimated the complications of the assessment of damages. Thirdly, the judge’s point at [85] that the consequential loss was always going to arise in the relatively near future seems to me to be irrelevant.  The fact that a loss will in due course be sustained without the intervention of a tortfeasor has no bearing on whether that loss should count, or whether it is unquantifiable, when the tortfeasor does inflict it.  Again, however, given my conclusion about the consequential loss, that is not material either. </p>
