The Appellant (“father”) sought contact with his child, A, who was born in 2011 and is now aged 9 years.  The Respondent (“mother”) opposed all forms of contact consequent upon, what she described as, the father’s “abhorrent behaviour” during the latter part of their relationship.  The judge heard evidence over 4 days, including oral evidence from both the mother and father.  At the conclusion of the case, the judge made the following findings: </p>

The father is doctor who qualified in Bulgaria, but came to work in the UK in a number of years ago after the parents had met whilst the mother was visiting her parents in Bulgaria.  The parents lived together in a property bought with the help of the maternal grandparents, and A was born in 2011.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It was the events of the 11 September 2012 upon which the finding of fact hearing largely focused. It was the custom of the grandparents to get up at about 6:00am to work in their garden. They were in the habit of making coffee first thing and drinking it on the veranda in a leisurely way during the course of the morning. On this particular morning, the mother called to the grandmother from her bedroom saying that she did not want coffee and would stay in bed for a while. The father, in contrast, did not usually get up before 10:00am. On this morning he got up at about 7:30am after the grandmother had prepared the coffee and poured it out for herself and her husband. </p>

Seeing her mother’s coffee, the mother changed her mind about wanting a drink and picked up her mother’s mug of coffee and drank about half of it. During the course of the morning, the grandmother drank the other half of her coffee and the grandfather, as was his habit, sipped his from time to time until he had finished his drink. </p>

He did not turn to greet her but remained where he was for some moments before turning around. In so far as this evidence was concerned, the judge made the following findings: </p>

The mother was also feeling unwell but believed that she had caught a viral infection from A.  The judge found that, due to the father’s insistence, the family set off on the long journey back to the UK that night rather than the following morning as planned. The mother, father and A therefore left at approximately 10:00pm, notwithstanding that no accommodation had been booked until the following night. The father’s case was that the car was overloaded and he wished to give himself plenty of time for the journey. </p>

She returned to the Royal Free raising the possibility that she had been poisoned.  She was sent away with a similar diagnosis, namely that this was stress related.   </p>

The mother then went to Charing Cross Hospital where there is a toxicology laboratory and tests were taken for poisoning. </p>

It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed. Earlier statements of this kind are discussed by Lord Bingham in his well-known essay <span style="font-style:italic">The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues</span> (from The Business of Judging, Oxford 2000). But a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the evidence. Heuristics or mental short cuts are no substitute for this essential judicial function. In particular, where a party's sworn evidence is disbelieved, the court must say why that is; it cannot simply ignore the evidence. </p>

That fact made it inherently improbable that details of all their interactions over the creation of the screenplay would be fully recorded in documents. Ms Kogan's case was that they were bouncing ideas off each other at speed, whereas Mr Martin regarded their interactions as his use of Ms Kogan as a sounding board. Which of these was, objectively, a correct description of their interaction was not likely to be resolved by documents alone, but was a fundamental issue which required to be resolved. </p>

The two documents to which the judge referred at [79] strongly supported an inference that the parties were collaborating on the screenplay at the outset, but the judge declined to draw any inference from them, instead observing that this was early in the project and that the affectionate language used gave little idea of how the parties planned to work together on the subsequent drafts. It was, however, important for the judge to come to a conclusion as to the basis on which the original outline was created. He was tasked with deciding, in the words of Keating J, whether Ms Kogan and Mr Martin had "undertaken jointly to write a [screen]play, agreeing in the general outline and design, and sharing the labour of working it out". Their approach at the outset was highly relevant.” </p>

Here, it is argued by Mr Tyler that the judge failed to have any proper awareness of the fallibility of memory. This, he said, coupled with a failure to properly analyse all the surrounding facts - by reference to the documentary evidence in the form of contemporary or near contemporary statements - and known or probable facts, had resulted in the judge having made a wholly unsafe finding that the father was ‘leaning over’ the coffee cups when the mother came onto the veranda. The judge, Mr Tyler submits, relied too heavily on the impression given by the mother in the witness box, as is demonstrated by her having found (as set out at [11] above but repeated here for convenience): </p>

Fairness required a rigorous analysis of all the evidence relevant to the ‘leaning over’ issue. In my judgment, the judge inappropriately favoured an aspect of the oral evidence of the mother over a significant amount of contemporaneous and written evidence, without reference to that evidence, or sufficiently explaining why she had done this.

With great respect to the judge, a finding that the father ‘disliked’ the grandmother is insufficient without more to underpin a finding of a motive on the father’s part for setting out deliberately to kill two people; an action which would have required some planning, not least the acquisition of the poison. Without careful forensic scrutiny of all the relevant evidence, the finding by the judge that the father’s motive was to kill the grandparents as a means to get them out of his and his partner’s life, whilst at the same time he sat by and watched that same partner drink poisoned coffee, amounted, in my judgment, to speculation. </p>

If my Lady and my Lord agree, I would simply allow the appeal on Ground 1 (e), the “‘leaning over’” ground, and Ground 4, “speculation as to motive”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Tyler submits that the appeal should be allowed, that there should be no retrial, and the father’s application for contact with A should now proceed on the basis that there are no contraindications to contact. Contact to A should now, he says, be reintroduced. There is, Mr Tyler suggests, no evidence upon which a judge could properly find that the father set out deliberately to kill the grandparents by administering thallium to their coffee. I disagree. The father accepts that the grandfather’s death and the illness of the grandmother and mother were caused by thallium poisoning. He accepts that it is a possibility that the poison was administered as the result of a deliberate act, he does not rule out coffee as the vehicle for the poison, (although says that inadequate consideration was given to the water in the pump in the garden). In those circumstances, it seems to me that the matter must be remitted for a retrial before a High Court Judge in order for the court to determine if the poison was administered deliberately into the grandparents’ coffee, and if that is the case then, if possible, to identify the perpetrator. </p>
