	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is unnecessary to say much about the details of the underlying claims, which relate to adjacent properties at Lodge Farm in Welwyn, Hertfordshire – the main house, which is occupied by Gary and Kim Marshall; the Cottage, which is occupied by their son Brett; and the Barn, which is said to be unoccupied.  All three properties are the subject of a mortgage securing a loan to Gary Marshall.  The mortgagees assert that sums due under the loan agreement are in arrears and/or that Gary Marshall is in breach of other terms of the agreement.  The Appellant was appointed as receiver by the mortgagees.  On 24 September 2019 he commenced two sets of possession proceedings in the Hertford County Court against Gary Marshall in F00HF362 and against his son and persons unknown in F00HF363 under Part 55 of the Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”). Kim Marshall was later substituted as second defendant to F00HF363.  The claims are contested.  The nature of the issues can be sufficiently seen from the agreed Case Summaries as follows. </p>

A case management conference was listed before HHJ Parfitt on 26 March 2020.  It did not in fact take place, for reasons into which it is unnecessary to go, but the parties were able to agree directions on that day.  Those directions were incorporated in an order sealed by Judge Parfitt on 27 March 2020 – the day that PD 51Z came into force.  They required various procedural steps including disclosure by 1 May 2020, inspection by 15 May 2020 and exchange of witness statements by 26 June 2020.  The trial window was between 5 October 2020 and 8 January 2021.  There was provision for a telephone listing appointment, on a date to be notified to the parties in due course.   </p>

It is fair to say, however, that their failure to do so was venial.   PD 51Z, so to speak, came out of nowhere, and they had to prepare submissions as a matter of urgency in a novel situation.  If the point had occurred to them, a case might still have been made that the issue could have been properly determined in the existing County Court proceedings.  Those were private law proceedings into which the issues raised by the PD 51Z had been unexpectedly thrust; and the challenge to its validity was in that sense entirely collateral.  Nor were the issues which it raised exclusively of a public law character: on the contrary, there were questions as to the scope and meaning of PD 51Z as well as in relation to its validity, and there was indeed a degree of overlap between those issues.  Having said all that the correct course would probably still have been to seek a stay or transfer of the County Court proceedings so that the <span style="font-style:italic">vires</span> challenge could be raised by judicial review, albeit with some creative case management so as to ensure that all the issues were heard in the same forum.   </p>

It is inevitable that permission to apply for judicial review would have been granted, so the Appellant has not stolen a procedural march.  The Lord Chancellor is now, however belatedly, a party: indeed the clarity and comprehensiveness of Mr Auburn’s submissions somewhat undermined his reliance on the difficulties caused by the late joinder.  He has, it is true, not had the opportunity to put in evidence (though he has, very properly, disclosed two internal documents preceding the making of the Practice Direction); but the issues are not of a kind on which evidence, or factual findings at first instance, is essential.  Taken with the other circumstances of the case referred to in the previous paragraph, those points might or might not be sufficient to justify our entertaining the issue, but what is in our view conclusive is that there is a strong public interest in an early and authoritative ruling as to the validity of PD 51Z.  Having had full argument on that issue we believe that we are in a position to give such a ruling despite the imperfections in the procedural history, and we should do so. </p>

The Respondents and the Lord Chancellor submit that PD 51Z is a pilot for future practices and procedures that may be introduced to deal with the continuing problems caused by Covid-19 or other pandemics or in other emergencies. They submit that the Master of the Rolls may well wish, on the basis of experience gained as a result of PD 51Z, to make a permanent rule providing for similar stays, or other measures, to be imposed in future crises. </p>

The meaning of that language is plain.  A stay of possession proceedings is being trialled in order to assess whether it is effective to ensure that the administration of justice, specifically the ongoing conduct of possession proceedings in a pandemic, and the enforcement of possession orders in a pandemic, does not endanger public health. </p>

We can see no reason why it is not reasonable to envisage that the stay imposed by paragraph 2 may be shown to be effective: (a) to relieve pressures on the administration of justice during the pandemic, (b) to reduce the risks of spreading the virus occasioned by enforcing possession orders and thereby forcing citizens to move home rather than stay at home as the Government has advised, and/or (c) to abrogate court hearings, whether remotely or face to face, in possession proceedings, thereby avoiding the need for court staff and litigating parties to risk transmission of the virus.  Once that has been assessed, we cannot see why it may not be appropriate for the Master of the Rolls to consider putting in place a permanent rule or PD that imposes a limited stay on possession proceedings when and if the pandemic peaks again. </p>

Paragraph 2(3) of schedule 29 includes a new requirement in the Rent Act 1977 to serve  three months’ notice of intention to commence proceedings against statutory tenants, and the new section 3(4B) gives landlords a right to apply to the court to dispense with the new notice requirement if the court considers it “just and equitable to do so”.  It is submitted that PD 51Z renders that right nugatory, because any proceedings commenced to resolve such an issue would be stayed immediately.  The Appellant gives other examples.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In our judgment, these submissions are not well founded.  Imposing notice requirements and giving power to lift them are one thing; a blanket stay of all possession proceedings is another.  They are not inconsistent.  The Coronavirus Act 2020 will last for two years (subject to extensions), but the pilot stay only lasts for 90 days.  It is true that some of the provisions of schedule 29 will have greater significance once the pilot stay comes to an end, but the argument that the Coronavirus Act 2020 renders PD 51Z unlawful is not tenable. There is simply no conflict between them.  They make separate and different provisions.  The Act changes the substantive law, and PD 51Z imposes a temporary stay to protect and manage County Court capacity, and to ensure the effective administration of justice without endangering public health during a peak phase of the pandemic. </p>

Lord Hope at [72] said: “I have always believed that a court of unlimited jurisdiction is the master of its own procedure. But that does not mean that the court can do what it likes.

PD 51Z creates no risk that persons will “effectively be prevented from having access to justice”.  Moreover, it was not seriously suggested that PD 51Z did not have the clear authorisation of Parliament, provided, of course, CPR Part 51.2 was properly applicable to it, as we have held it is.  CPR Part 51.2 is authorised by primary legislation in the form of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and section 5 of the Civil Procedure Act 1997. </p>

Secondly, he submitted that the court must have a general discretion to lift the stay imposed by paragraph 2 taking into account: (a) the impossibility of implicitly disapplying CPR Part 3.1(1) and (2)(f) and section 49(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, (b) the cases that show that other pilot schemes have been disapplied in particular cases, and (c) the fact that, if the parties can agree to disapply the stay by agreeing directions, the court must be able to do so too. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The construction point is easily dealt with.  In our view when paragraph 2A(c) says that paragraph 2 does not apply to “an application for” agreed case management directions, it means what it says – that is, that if the parties agree directions, they can apply to the court to have the directions in question embodied in an order.  Mr Rainey submitted that that would be an empty right if the agreed directions themselves remained subject to the stay, and that the provision should be construed as lifting the stay so far as agreed directions are concerned.  We do not agree.  In the first place, that is not what paragraph 2A(c) says.  Secondly, giving the words used their literal meaning does not produce an empty result.  There is an obvious value in the parties agreeing, and obtaining the court’s endorsement of, directions which will take effect on a date or dates post-dating the end of the stay: they will come out of the end of the stay with an already-established timetable, and avoid a potential rush to make applications immediately the stay is lifted.  Thirdly, there is also value in the parties agreeing, and obtaining the court’s endorsement of, directions which take effect during the stay albeit they cannot be enforced during its currency: we see no reason why parties cannot for example, get on with agreed directions for disclosure on a voluntary basis during the stay, and thereafter, seek to adjust any post-stay case management timetable by reference to steps agreed to be taken during the period of the stay. Fourthly, if Mr Rainey’s construction were to be of value parties would presumably have to be entitled to apply to the court during the currency of the stay if the agreed directions were not complied with; but that is precisely the kind of activity which the stay is evidently intended to prevent.  Finally, as to the construction of paragraph 2A(c), we note that the drafters could easily have said that “paragraph 2 does not apply to case management directions agreed by the parties”, but they did not do so. The carve out, as drafted, is obviously directed at allowing the court to embody agreed directions in a court order notwithstanding the stay, and nothing more.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the power to lift the stay, CPR Part 3.1 sets out the court’s general powers of case management.  Part 3.1(1) provides that “[t]he list of powers in this rule is in addition to any powers given to the court by any other rule or practice direction or by any other enactment or any powers it may otherwise have”.  CPR Part 3.1(2)(f) provides that “[e]xcept where these Rules provide otherwise, the court may… (f) stay the whole or part of any proceedings or judgment either generally or until a specified date or event”.  Section 49(3) of the 1981 Act provides that “[n]othing in this Act shall affect the power of the Court of Appeal or the High Court to stay any proceedings before it, where it thinks fit to do so, either of its own motion or on the application of any person, whether or not a party to the proceedings”.  The power to impose a stay necessarily includes the power to lift it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In our view PD 51Z cannot be read as formally excluding the operation of CPR 3.1.  As a matter of strict jurisdiction, therefore, a judge retains the power to lift the stay which it imposes.  But the proper exercise of that power is informed by the nature of the stay and the purposes for which it was evidently imposed.  PD 51Z imposes a general stay on proceedings of the kind to which it applies, initially subject to no qualification at all, and subsequently qualified only in the limited and specific respects provided for in paragraph 2A.  The purpose was that during the 90-day period the burden on judges and staff in the County Court of having to deal with possession proceedings, which are an immense part of its workload, would be lifted, and also that the risk to public health of proceeding with evictions would be avoided.  That purpose is of its nature blanket in character and does not allow for distinctions between cases where the stay may operate more or less harshly on (typically) the claimant.  It would be fatally undermined if parties affected by the stay were entitled to rely on their particular circumstances – however special they might be said to be – as the basis on which the stay should be lifted in their particular case.  Thus, while we would not go so far as to say that there could be no circumstances in which it would be proper for a judge to order that the stay imposed by PD 51Z should be lifted in a particular case, we have great difficulty in envisaging such a case.  The only possible such case canvassed before us was where the stay would operate in such a way as to defeat the purposes of PD 51Z and endanger public health.  The decision of Judge Freedman in <span style="font-style:italic">Bernicia Group v. Mark Mann</span> (17 April 2020; D4PP284A; County Court at Newcastle) may have been of that character, but we do not know enough about the circumstances of the case to say so definitively. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The fact that there is no express inhibition on lifting the stay takes the matter no further. In our judgment, the Master of the Rolls must be taken to have been fully cognisant of the wide case management powers we have mentioned. The stay is nonetheless unconditional.  The fact that the parties are permitted to agree case management directions in the way we have mentioned neither itself involves a lifting of the stay, nor points to a general power in the court to lift the stay.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It follows that we do not think that any normal case management reasons could be enough to justify an individual judge lifting the stay imposed by PD 51Z.  The reasons for it make it clear that they go far beyond any individual relationship of landlord and tenant or mortgagee and mortgagor.  The blanket stay has been imposed to protect public health and the administration of justice generally. The approach of a blanket stay reflects the balance struck by the Master of the Rolls, and makes clear that possession claims are not to be dealt with on a normal case by case basis during the stay. We would strongly deprecate parties troubling the court with applications that are based only on such reasons and which are in truth bound to fail. </p>

In general terms, no steps in the action, by either side, are required or permitted during the period of the stay. When the stay is lifted, or the stay expires, the position as between the parties should be the same as it was at the moment that the stay was imposed.

The judge made his order on 15 April 2020 (before PD 51Z was amended) postponing the agreed directions until after the expiry of the stay. What the judge did by paragraph 4 of his order on 15 April 2020 (before PD 51Z was amended) was positively to postpone the agreed directions until after the expiry of the stay.  We think that at that stage he should not have done so, because he should not have countenanced any application at all in contradiction of the stay. He should simply have dismissed the application for a declaration and to lift the stay. The parties had, at that stage, to wait until the end of the stay to make any application to the court, because there was no paragraph 2A(c) in force.  Had the parties applied for agreed case management directions after paragraph 2A(c) came into force, the judge could have made them, even if they envisaged steps being taken by agreement during the stay.  But, in the absence of agreement, no directions could or should be made. </p>

He submitted that otherwise the trial will be that much delayed, whilst cases of other types take precedence.  We are afraid to say that that is a natural and intended consequence of the stay imposed by PD 51Z.  The judge should not even have made the directions in paragraph 4 of his order, to which we already have referred, even if they were agreed, because paragraph 2A(c) was not then in force.  In point of fact, however, it is not quite clear from his judgment whether paragraph 4 of the order was agreed. Judge Parfitt ends his judgment by saying: “I will make an order moving the [telephone listing appointment] for the trial to after the stay is over and also assist by pushing back the start of the existing trial window by 4 weeks.  I would ask Counsel please to draft an appropriate order”.  Insofar as these directions can now be agreed, we would be prepared to allow them to remain in place under paragraph 2A(c).  If they are not now agreed, paragraph 4 of the judge’s order must be deleted. </p>
