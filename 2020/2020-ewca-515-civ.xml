For reasons set out in a judgment which I discuss in detail below, Judge Hillier (‘the judge’) dismissed the mother’s application for the summary return of the children from Libya; the judge concluded that the English court had no jurisdiction to make such an order:  </p>

In granting permission, Moylan LJ remarked that the “Grounds of Appeal and Skeleton raise sufficient issues to justify the grant of permission although the appeal appears to be very largely, and possibly solely, from findings of fact and will therefore have to surmount the high threshold for the Court of Appeal to interfere with findings of fact”.   </p>

They have lived in England for most of their married life, save for a period of about five months in 2013-2014 when they lived in Libya.  All three children were born in England.

The mother had expected that her youngest child, F, would be travelling with her, but shortly before their scheduled departure the father advised her that he had not been able to secure an exit visa for F.  During the early part of 2018, and while in England, the mother made contact with her current solicitors, Dawson Cornwell, a lawyer in Libya, the Libyan embassy, Reunite, and others, seeking advice about her situation.  During the year, the mother travelled between Libya and England five times; she spent approximately four months in total in Libya during 2018, and the balance of the time in England.  The children and the father remained in Libya throughout this period.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">On 3 December 2018, the mother issued proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court seeking the summary return of the children to this jurisdiction. By her application, she asserted that the children had been “forcibly retained” in Libya “while we were there on holiday”.  She alleged that the father was “shortly… due to travel to England and Wales”, hence (she maintained) the need for urgent protective orders.   At a hearing on the day of the issue of proceedings, the children were made Wards of Court, and a Tipstaff passport order was made; the hearing had been conducted without notice to the father, justified according to the mother, by reason of the father’s imminent arrival in this jurisdiction, and the risk that he would not travel here, or would take steps permanently to separate the mother from her children if he knew of the court process.  The court further made provision for a return date at short notice; a long-stop date of 17 May 2019 was set for the next hearing.  In fact, the father did not travel to England at that time, or indeed at any time since.   </p>

Although Miss Langdale extended a tempting invitation to us to dip into selected parts of the “sea of evidence”, and took us to a few of “the islands” (see [47] above), I was left unpersuaded that these ‘islands’ of evidence, even taken cumulatively and accepted at face value, would make any or any significant difference to the judge’s overall conclusions.   The most that could be said, in my judgment, is that had the judge extended her analysis and assessment yet further with reference to some or all of the documents highlighted by Miss Langdale in her submissions, the judgment may have been more contoured, but the conclusions not different.   As Miss Langdale focussed our attention on (a) the content of the text messages, and (b) the e-mail to the Libyan lawyer, I in turn address those documents, and her arguments, specifically. </p>

I was not persuaded that Miss Langdale made good her submission in this regard either: first, the text message in question was dated April 2019 (i.e. four months after the date the English Court was seised), and secondly, the judge explicitly acknowledged that the absence of the mother in the children’s lives would have operated as a brake on their acquisition of habitual residence in Libya (see [75] below). </p>

Extracts of this email are located in this judgment at [33] and [42] above.  When the e-mail is read in its totality, it does not, in my judgment, validate the mother’s case that the father had ‘wrongfully retained’ the children in Libya; rather, it conveys the clear impression that the mother wished to resume life in Libya albeit in a different way.  Specifically, the mother proposed that she and the father could or should live together with the children, but separate from the paternal family.  At the very least, the contents of this e-mail corresponded with, and indeed underlined, the correctness of the judge’s conclusion (and to which I have made reference at [32] above) that in the first half of 2018 period this mother was unclear in her own mind as to what she wanted for the future.  If that latter point needed re-inforcing, it would be found in the fact that, having received support and/or advice following the communications (of which this was one) in the first half of 2018, the mother delayed in taking any steps to seek the return of the children until December 2018 (see again [33] above).   </p>

The corollary was that the mother faced a formidable task in persuading the court at first instance that the father had ‘wrongfully retained’ the children some 14 days later.   This challenge was manifestly not met by the mother, for the reasons which the judge set out in her judgment, which I have reproduced at [31]-[34] above.  Perhaps most significant among the findings were that: (a) the mother’s return to England at this time was discussed between the parties; there was no apparent suggestion that the older children would be accompanying her, and there was, so far as I can tell, no challenge to the evidence that an exit visa had genuinely not been obtained for F; (b) the father </p>

Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">For my part, I am clear that the judge conscientiously appraised the parties, and assessed their reliability on the key issues of fact; she had the considerable advantage of doing so from her unique position as the trial judge.  In a structured judgment, she performed a wholly satisfactory assessment of the evidence.  While she plainly did not refer to all of the material filed or adduced orally, nor specifically to the troubled political climate and security issues in Libya, she drew on a sufficiently extensive range of the evidence in this factually complex case, in a way which was in my view appropriately reflective of the preponderance of the evidence, to demonstrate those factors which particularly influenced her in reaching her conclusion.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in">No material error has, in my judgment, been exposed by the judge’s failure to include or discuss aspects of the evidence which the mother, through counsel, has highlighted on the appeal.  In this regard, I was not persuaded that taking the ‘island hopping’ journey, so attractively advocated by Miss Langdale, led me to a different outcome from that reached by the judge.  The judge’s ultimate conclusion on the issue of jurisdiction, supported by a combination of sufficiently carefully analysed findings of fact and by a proper rehearsal and application of the law, is, in my view, secure.  </p>
