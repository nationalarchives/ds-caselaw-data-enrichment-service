	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal raises an important issue arising from the implementation of the new system of universal credit providing social security benefits.  Universal credit is described in the evidence before this Court as marking a fundamental move away from previous policies for supporting the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society.  It has been a central platform of the Government’s social policy reform agenda since 2010 and will be the most significant welfare reform in the past 70 years.  It is intended to make social entitlement provision fairer, more affordable and better able to tackle poverty, worklessness and welfare dependency.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (‘SSWP’) appeals against the order of the Divisional Court (Singh LJ and Lewis J) following the judgment of that court handed down on 11 January 2019.  Permission to appeal was granted by Hickinbottom LJ on 5 November 2019. The case concerns the application of the provisions of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/376) (‘the Regulations’) which set out how a claimant’s earned income is calculated for each monthly assessment period within that claimant’s period of entitlement to universal credit.  The amount of earned income in an assessment period is an important element when working out how much benefit the claimant will be awarded for that assessment period. The dispute arises because, broadly, the system for identifying the income earned by a claimant in a particular assessment period does not accommodate the fact that people who are usually paid their salary on a particular day each month, such as on the last day of the month, will in fact be paid on a different day if their usual payment date falls on a weekend or bank holiday.  In certain circumstances this leads to two monthly salary payments falling within one of the monthly assessment periods applicable for that claimant.  The claimant’s universal credit award in respect of that assessment period is then greatly reduced in response to the apparently high level of income received.  In the next assessment period they will typically receive no monthly salary payment.  In response to that apparent sudden drop in income, they will subsequently get a much higher universal credit award.  I shall refer to that problem in this judgment as caused by “the non-banking day salary shift”.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Although one might think that this would even itself out over time, there are two reasons why the Respondents argue that that is not a sufficient answer and why they have brought these proceedings to challenge this aspect of how the scheme operates.  The first is that the great fluctuations in income each month, aggravated by the fact that universal credit is paid in arrears, make it very difficult for claimants to budget for their stable monthly outgoings.  This causes them to incur additional costs such as overdraft fees, high interest on short term loans or unpaid bills, and in some instances court fees to prevent landlords evicting them if they fall behind with their rent.  Even more concerning is that claimants affected by this problem irrevocably lose money over the course of a year because they lose the opportunity to receive the work allowance for the assessment period when they appear to have nil income.  The work allowance is the amount of salary that a universal credit claimant can earn before their award of benefit is reduced.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Divisional Court held that the problem had arisen because the SSWP had wrongly construed regulation 54 of the Regulations which sets out the general principles for calculating earned income.  They held that the wording of the provision did not, as the SSWP had argued, require that all earned income received in a particular assessment period be included in the calculation of the claimant’s universal credit award in respect of that period.  The wording of the regulation indicated that an adjustment has to be made where, as here, some of the income received in fact relates to a different assessment period.  The SSWP appeals to this Court arguing that the Divisional Court was wrong to construe regulation 54 in that way.  Such a construction, she says, throws the whole operation of the universal credit system approved by Parliament into confusion because the calculation of the appropriate award for each assessment period for the millions of claimants each month is an automated process requiring clear, easily identified inputs.  This is achieved by basing the award on the actual amount of income received in the assessment period without considering whether it relates in some subjective way to that period or to another period. The Regulations cannot achieve what Parliament intended to achieve when setting up the scheme if the SSWP has to perform the kind of evaluative exercise of working out which income received relates to which assessment period that the Divisional Court’s construction seems to mandate.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Respondents seek to uphold the Divisional Court’s construction of the regulation largely for the reasons given by that Court.  They have also served a Respondents’ Notice raising two challenges on which they rely if the SSWP is right about how to construe the Regulations. They argue that the result of the SSWP’s construction for these claimants and the many thousands of other claimants in the same position is so arbitrary and contrary to the aims of the universal credit reforms that the Regulations should be struck down on grounds of irrationality in so far as they mandate that result.  Secondly, the Respondents assert that the Regulations discriminate against them contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’), in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1.  </p>

Ms Johnson brought separate proceedings also in April 2018 and the two sets of proceedings were linked by order of Lang J in July 2018.  Ms Woods described the decision she was challenging as the ongoing decision of SSWP not to amend her assessment period for universal credit purposes every time that two monthly wage payments fall to be included in one assessment period. The decision to be judicially reviewed in Ms Johnson’s claim was said to be the decision to calculate her entitlement to universal credit in an assessment period based on the day she applied for universal credit. In both the claim forms the basis for the challenge was discrimination contrary to article 14 ECHR and irrationality.  Ms Johnson in addition alleged a breach of the public sector equality duty and Ms Woods alleged a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield </span>principle (named after <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield v Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food </span>[1968] AC 997), asserting that the Regulations undermine the purpose of the primary legislation.

She worked part-time during her studies. Her daughter was born in September 2012 and Ms Johnson was for a time a full-time mother claiming income support allowance, child tax credits, child benefit, housing benefit and council tax reduction. When her daughter started school, Ms Johnson was offered a job as a dinner lady at a local school. Ms Johnson says she really enjoys her job and that the set days and hours work well with her childcare responsibilities. She describes how proud she was that she had found a job by herself: “When I was told I had the job, I cried down the phone because I was so happy to have a job that worked around my daughter’s childcare needs. It was a massive relief.”  Although she only worked during term time, her pay was spread evenly throughout the year so each month she was paid £472.  She is paid her salary on the last working day of each month unless that day is a non-banking day in which case she is paid early.  Part of the attraction of the job was, she says, that it provided a regular, steady income which gave her security.  </p>

The overriding policy rationale was, he says, “to make the journey into work smoother by removing some of the frictions in the legacy system.” He explains in detail how the DWP arrived at the decision that an assessment period should be one month long rather than weekly like many legacy benefits or yearly like tax credits.  Ms McMahon is Head of Service Design, Business Architecture and Product Impacting and has oversight of the build and structure of the universal credit service.  She addresses various suggestions put forward by the Respondents as to how the system could be amended or designed to avoid the problem that has arisen from the non-banking day salary shift.  She also describes the process of Parliamentary scrutiny and consultation on universal credit, particularly on the question of whether the assessment period should be monthly.

The Court then considered the wider context of the Regulations in the structure created by the WRA. That Act was intended to confer an entitlement to welfare benefit to be comprised of amounts reflecting the needs of individuals in terms of the elements of caring for children, housing costs and other prescribed needs. Part at least of the underlying aim was to facilitate or encourage people to work and to that end regulations prescribed the amount of earned income to be deducted from the amount of universal credit otherwise payable and conversely the amount of earned income that could be retained by the claimant without having any effect on the amount of benefit paid: [45]. Turning to the specific context, the Divisional Court referred to regulation 22 stipulating when the work allowance applies.  </heading>

The definition of “earned income” in regulation 52 is deliberately drawn very widely to catch not only remuneration from conventional employment under a contract of service but pay received for a trade or “any other paid work”.  The cohort of people likely to be claiming universal credit will contain many people whose work is of a casual, sporadic nature and who receive their payment for that work in lump sums or instalments rather than in regular amounts.  The general principles set out in regulation 54 have to apply to all those kinds of work and all those patterns of income. The regulation is not specific to those in employment still less to those working for an RTI employer. During the course of argument many different commonly-occurring instances were discussed where people receive money for work which they have performed in a different assessment period from the period in which the money is received. A person may receive a commission or bonus payment rewarding them for achieving a sales target as a result of work performed over the previous six months; a tradesman may take on a job and receive an upfront payment before starting the job, then work for a number of months and receive a lump-sum payment at the end of the job, or in weekly instalments following the end of the job.  In each case the actual receipt could be said not to be earned income in respect of the assessment period in which it is received but in respect of a number of assessment periods including that one or in respect of one or more entirely different assessment periods.   </p>

The formulation in the final sentence of paragraph 56 was that an adjustment may be needed where “the actual amounts received in an assessment period do not, in fact, reflect the earned income payable in respect of that period”.  Whether these two formulations were intended to limit the circumstances where an adjustment is needed to the circumstances in which these Respondents find themselves but not to other commonly occurring circumstances is not clear.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Divisional Court rejected the argument that a broad interpretation of regulation 54 opened up the possibility of many claimants arguing that their earned income should not necessarily be the same as their actual receipts during one or more of their assessment periods.  The Court said that in those other cases it may well be that the appropriate starting point is to base the earned income on the actual amounts received and that depending on the circumstances there will not be any reason for considering that that results in an incorrect calculation: para 57.  The present circumstances involved employees working on a monthly basis and paid a monthly salary and in those circumstances regulation 54 required that such an adjustment could be made.  The difficulty that I see with rejecting SSWP’s argument for that reason is that the Court’s construction of regulation 54 produces wording that provides no guidance as to when the starting point should also be the finishing point, or when the application of regulation 54 does result in an incorrect calculation of the earned income in respect of that assessment period.  The potential breadth of the provision as construed by the Divisional Court is apparent from the wording of the declaration granted in the order under appeal. That states that the earned income is to be based on, but not necessarily the same as, the actual receipt in that assessment period. Although the declaration refers back to the reasoning of the Court’s judgment, it does not otherwise attempt to describe when the earned income will not be the same as the amount actually received.   </p>

That is essential because, as Mr Brown submitted, the system of universal credit is intended to be automated so that the calculation of the monthly amount can be performed by a computer rather than a DWP officer able to make an evaluative determination.   </p>

The Divisional Court also rejected that argument on the grounds that the Regulations clearly do contemplate manual intervention in some circumstances. Regulation 61 contemplates that there are circumstances where the SSWP will need to decide what information to use when accurate and timely information is not forthcoming from the RTI employer.  Again, this does not meet the SSWP’s objection that the interpretation set out in the declaration made by the Divisional Court opens up the possibility of very many more and varied occasions where manual intervention would be necessary to determine whether the amount received in the assessment period really is earned income payable in respect of that assessment period.

The phrase “earned income in respect of an assessment period” used in regulation 54 and similar phrases are used elsewhere in the WRA and the Regulations where they do not denote that some kind of allocation or attribution is required.  For example, section 7 WRA refers to universal credit being “payable in respect of each complete assessment period”.  In section 10(1), the WRA provides that universal credit is to include “an amount <span style="font-weight:bold">for</span> each child” for whom a claimant is responsible but subsection 10(1A) refers to the amount being available “<span style="font-weight:bold">in respect of</span> a maximum of two persons”.

If, for example, the amount actually received in the assessment period included expenses falling within regulation 55(3)(a) or (b), those would need to be disregarded in the calculation of the claimant’s earned income. It would be wrong therefore were the provision to state simply that a person’s earned income “is” the actual amount received in that period; it is correct to say that the calculation of the claimant’s earned income is to be based on the actual amounts received in that period. The adjustments to be made are, however, limited to those contemplated in the Regulations such as regulation 55.  The existence of adjustments mandated by other regulations is, in my view, the “other factor” which the Court identified at para 51 as needing to be addressed by the calculation in addition to the mere mechanical addition of monies received in a particular period.   </p>

A wider construction of the phrase “to be based on” in regulation 61 would not give rise to the problems envisaged by the SSWP, since that regulation is limited to the specific case of an employee working for an RTI employer.

The amount actually received in the assessment period not only forms the starting point but will also be the finishing point, subject to the making of any relevant adjustments expressly provided for in the Regulations.  What is alleged to be irrational is the initial and ongoing failure of the SSWP to include in the Regulations a further express adjustment to avoid the consequence of the combination of the non-banking day salary shift and the application of regulation 54 for claimants in the position of the Respondents.  Mr Brown at the hearing fairly accepted that the consequence of regulation 54 for these Respondents was arbitrary and that there was no policy reason why these particular Respondents should face the difficulties that they describe.  The SSWP’s case is that a solution has not been devised or implemented because other factors outweigh the desirability of finding an answer to the problem.

The irrationality asserted here is the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness that has been a ground for a public law challenge since the early days of the modern jurisprudence on judicial review.

This legal basis for judicial review has two aspects. The first is concerned with whether the decision under review is capable of being justified or whether in the classic <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> formulation it is "so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it": see <span style="font-style:italic">Associated Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp</span> [1948] 1 KB 223, 233-4. Another, simpler formulation of the test which avoids tautology is whether the decision is outside the range of reasonable decisions open to the decisionmaker: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Boddington v British Transport Police</span> [1998] UKHL 13; [1999] 2 AC 143, 175 (Lord Steyn). The second aspect of irrationality/unreasonableness is concerned with the process by which the decision was reached. A decision may be challenged on the basis that there is a demonstrable flaw in the reasoning which led to it – for example, that significant reliance was placed on an irrelevant consideration, or that there was no evidence to support an important step in the reasoning, or that the reasoning involved a serious logical or methodological error. ….” </p>

The Divisional Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Law Society </span>held that the policy was unlawful for various reasons, but they rejected a challenge to the Lord Chancellor’s decision relating to the counting of pages of prosecution evidence (‘PPE’). The number of PPE in a criminal case was one of a number of factors used in determining fees, as proxies for the complexity of the case and the amount and difficulty of the work involved.  The growth of the electronic evidence that counted as PPE had greatly increased and the Lord Chancellor’s response had been to reduce the cap on the maximum amount that influenced the level of fees from 10,000 PPE to 6,000. The Law Society argued that it was irrational simply to reduce the overall number of pages rather than to exclude certain kinds of electronic evidence from the definition of pages that counted.  The Divisional Court held that it was impossible to say that the reasons given for rejecting the option of restricting the definition of PPE to exclude certain types of electronic evidence were irrational: </p>

We accept that in principle it was open to the Lord Chancellor to adopt a policy response which did not directly correspond to the problem which it was designed to meet. A policy-maker may reasonably decide that the disadvantages of a finely tuned solution to a problem outweigh its advantages and that a broader measure is preferable, even if the broader measure is both over- and under-inclusive in that it catches some cases in which there is no or no significant problem and fails to catch some cases in which the problem occurs. Such an approach is in any event consistent with the nature of the Scheme, which uses criteria such as PPE as proxies for the complexity of cases. It is inherent in the use of such proxies that they will result in under-compensation in some cases. But this does not cause unfairness if it is off-set by overcompensation in other cases. What matters is that overall a reasonable balance is struck.” </p>

Ms Johnson states that she finds it impossible to budget for sudden drops in income in the months following an assessment period in which two salary instalments have been counted. She becomes overdrawn at the bank during the month in which the low universal credit award is received. She then incurs interest and bank charges. She expresses her doubts whether she will ever be able to get back on top of her finances and worries that cash flow problems will mean she is unable to pay her rent, jeopardising her tenancy.  Ms Woods also says that she feels unable ever to get a foothold on stabilising her finances. She has never previously been so far into her overdraft or unable to pay her rent. She has been forced to attend food banks.  Ms Stewart describes how in the months where she receives a reduced universal credit award because she is treated as having received two salary instalments in the preceding assessment period, she does not have enough income to cover her rent and childcare as well as other outgoings. She missed a rent payment and although the rent officer came to an agreement with her not to take legal action, she then had to pay an additional £50 a month on top of her rent to pay off arrears.  She has borrowed money from her employer. She says that she seems to be getting further into debt for something which was completely out of her control, even as she was trying to do the right thing and provide for her daughter and herself by going out to work.  Ms Barrett says that in the nine months since making her universal credit claim she has not had a single month where her award has been based on receiving just one monthly wage. Instead she has been treated either as receiving two wages and so receiving a substantially reduced universal credit award </p>

It is set up to respond immediately to changes in circumstances of claimants as they move in and out of work, or as their housing or other circumstances change. This is one of the ways that it incentivises work, a key policy underlying the new regime. It is not right therefore, Mr Brown submits, to describe oscillation of benefits as “perverse” because it is the reasonable and deliberate basis on which the system is designed.  I do not accept that the SSWP’s argument on this point has merit in the particular circumstances of this case.  The oscillations here are not a response to any change in the Respondents’ work patterns or family circumstances.  The oscillation is a response only to whether a claimant’s regular monthly pay date coincides with the end date of her assessment period so that she sometimes receives two monthly wages in one assessment period.  There has been no change in the claimants’ circumstances.  This has no part to play in incentivising work or encouraging any of the other kinds of behavioural change considered desirable.  It is no part of the policy underlying universal credit to encourage claimants or employers to adopt a non-monthly salary cycle; on the contrary the choice of monthly assessment periods was based in part on the increasing prevalence of that salary cycle amongst the working population and because many household bills are payable monthly.

Yet that is what is happening for these Respondents.  Ms Woods says that she was offered a promotion by her previous employer.  She was reluctant to take up the new position because if two months’ pay at the new salary level were counted in one assessment period she would be over the maximum income limit and would receive no universal credit award for that assessment period.  She has invested a great deal of time and money with a view to achieving a qualification as an occupational therapist. But to work as an occupational therapist, she needs experience in the NHS.  The NHS pays staff on the last working day of the month. Therefore, instead of pursuing her intended career, she obtained a secretarial position at a local livestock auction and worked as a waitress in a local café.

They cause considerable hardship and they create perverse incentives affecting a claimant’s employment choices, cutting across the policy of the overall scheme.  </p>

Ms Barrett, whose contractual pay date is fixed as the 28th day of the month rather than the last day of the month, suffers a similar loss.  In the course of 2018 there were five months when the 28th day fell on a weekend or bank holiday. According to the table in her second witness statement between 28 August 2017 and 27 August 2018 there were almost no assessment periods in which she received only one wage.  This loss of work allowance is money which is never recovered by the Respondents.  They receive less universal credit overall because of the coincidence of the end of their assessment period with their contracted salary pay date.  The judgment of the Divisional Court records the lost work allowance as £192 for each assessment period, that being the lower work allowance applicable to single claimants responsible for one or more child where their award contains an amount for housing costs element.  That was the work allowance in 2018.  For the current financial year from April 2020, the applicable work allowance is £292 so that the loss is now substantially greater. For a claimant who does not have a housing costs element in their award the figure was £397 in 2018 and is now £512. Ms Stewart’s evidence is that one month’s work allowance is a considerable amount in her situation as it represents over 10% of her usual combined income from universal credit and wages. Ms Johnson says that the loss of the work allowance in several months a year is very significant:  </p>

I reject that argument.  The value of the work allowance is presumably not chosen at random but based on some assessment of the additional amounts needed each month to support a claimant with the characteristics that Parliament has decided should attract the work allowance, namely being responsible for one or more children or having limited capability for work. The link between the amount of work allowance and the inclusion of a housing costs element in the claimant’s award also shows that the work allowance is connected to a typically stable and regular monthly household expenditure.  The monthly household costs incurred by these Respondents do not fluctuate according to whether the end of the month falls on a weekend.  The SSWP has put forward no reason why the date on which these Respondents submitted their claim for universal credit should result in them losing a considerable amount of money each year for however long their entitlement lasts.  In my judgment this is the most egregious aspect of the way the system works.   </p>

It is established by section 96 WRA and Part 7 of the Regulations (regulations 78 onwards).  Regulation 79 provides that the benefit cap applies where the welfare benefits to which a claimant is entitled during an assessment period exceed the amount set in regulation 80A.  Where the benefit cap applies its effect (as the name suggests) is that the amount of the award is reduced by the excess unless certain circumstances pertain.  Regulation 82 provides for an exception. Broadly, the benefit cap does not apply to an award of universal credit in relation to an assessment period where the claimant’s earned income equals or exceeds the amount she would earn if she worked for 16 hours per week at the national minimum wage; currently £604 per month. Although it may appear counterintuitive to lift the cap and thereby increase the benefits paid where a person is earning more than a set amount, this is part of the scheme designed to incentivise work as well as set a limit on the award of benefits to non-working households: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (SG and others) v SSWP </span>[2015] UKSC 16, [2015] 1 WLR 1449, paras 66 – 69.

However, it is relevant to show that the effects of the failure of the system to accommodate non-banking day salary shifts is not limited to the loss of the work allowance but arises in other parts of the regime which are triggered by the absolute amount of earned income in an assessment period. Ms Clarke’s evidence is that CPAG is aware of other universal credit claimants who have a higher maximum award which takes them over the benefit cap limit. Because they have a regular monthly salary which is more than the specified amount they are generally exempt from the benefit. However because they are also affected by the non-banking day salary shift there are some assessment periods where they are treated as not having received any wages. When this issue has been raised with DWP, a workaround has been put in place so that they are not subject to the benefit cap in those months where they appear to receive no salary.

The assessment period is, Mr Brown submits, a statutory construct which establishes the temporal cycle for the assessment and payment of universal credit.  It is not meant to be the same as a calendar month and its purpose is to capture actual income received within that defined period.  I accept that is right but only to an extent.  The evidence lodged by the SSWP makes it clear that the reason why the assessment period was set at a month, rather than a week like many legacy benefits, was because that was already the most common way in which people were paid and looked set to grow in popularity. This was also apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Regulations published on 25 February 2013. The Memorandum described a key difference between universal credit and legacy benefits as being that it will be assessed and paid monthly:  </p>

It is not right to say that there is no significant connection between the choice of a monthly assessment period cycle and the fact that many claimants are paid their salary monthly.

On that basis, everyone who is paid monthly would be regarded as paid “irregularly” by their employer since there is always the possibility that the contracted pay date falls on a non-banking day whether that pay date is expressed as the last day of the month or the 28th day of the month.  Even if the contracted pay date is the last Friday of the month, that Friday might fall on Christmas Day or Boxing Day, Good Friday or New Year’s Day.  I agree with the</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Brown submitted that a complex system like this is not going to work in an optimal way for everyone.  It was always appreciated that there would be people better off under the old system or under different versions of this system. The system will only work if it has clearly defined inputs which are simple to understand and to administer.  The nature of the potential claimant cohort is such that they are more likely to be moving in and out of work or working in the ‘gig economy’ so that their monthly income will vary greatly with the consequent effect on their universal credit award.  It is an inevitable consequence of such a system that there are hard cases and the Respondents’ position is simply a manifestation of that.  The SSWP refers again to examples of people who may receive two payments in one assessment period if they are paid a bonus or commission as well as their basic salary and to people who regularly receive lump sum payments for work carried out over a number of assessment periods.  Those in the latter category would also ‘lose’ a work allowance entitlement in the months when they are working but not receiving an instalment for the job done as compared with their entitlement if they were paid in a number of instalments.  </p>

In fact, there are already several exceptions to the bright lines set out in the Regulations where it is clear that a policy imperative has overridden the need for simplicity.  Regulation 76 provides that where a person receives a payment from an approved scheme providing compensation or support such as that given to people diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease or who suffered forced labour during the Second World War or who were victims of the Manchester bombing on 22 May 2017, such payment whether it is capital or income is to be disregarded when calculating unearned income.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The Respondents point out that the system appears to be capable of flexibility where this is in SSWP’s interests. The Regulations depart from a focus on actual amounts received in an assessment period by creating a category of notional unearned income, providing that if unearned income such as a state pension would be available to a person upon the making of an application for it, the person is to be treated as having that unearned income (regulation 74). Similarly, the Regulations provide that it is to be assumed that there is a yield from capital above a certain level so that, even though no such income is actually received, it is treated as part of the person’s capital from the date it is due to be paid to the person: (regulation 72).  The Respondents point to a different kind of exception in regulation 21A where the duration of the assessment period is adapted to create what was described as a ‘mini assessment period’. Regulation 21A applies when the first date of entitlement has been determined but it is subsequently determined that it should have fallen on a different start date. If the Secretary of State considers that changing the start date would cause unnecessary disruption to the administration of the claim she can activate regulation 21A, with the effect that the first assessment period is to be a short period beginning with the start date and the amount payable for that shorter first assessment period is the appropriate proportion of the monthly award. Ms Parker explains in her witness statement that this regulation was introduced in 2018 to deal with a specific problem where someone had an established assessment period, lost their entitlement to universal credit and then made a new claim establishing a different assessment period cycle. If they successfully appealed against the original loss of entitlement, they should in principle </p>

I agree that there will often be hard cases with people falling just on the wrong side of the line where their needs and circumstances are otherwise indistinguishable from those falling just on the right side – the requirement that the claimant be 18 years old is an obvious example.  It may well be rational to introduce such a requirement on the ground that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages arising from those bright lines.  In my judgment, however, those situations are readily distinguishable from the significant, predictable but arbitrary effects on benefit of a regular monthly salary which frequently falls into different assessment periods because of the non-banking day salary shift.   </p>

It cannot be impossible to draft an exception to cover the particular problem highlighted in this case. On this point I agree with Ms Richards’ submission that the SSWP must not allow the best to be the enemy of the good.  It is irrational to refuse to sort out this problem because there are other groups of claimants for whom it is too difficult to fashion an exception to the general rule.  It does not strike me as “odd in the extreme” that claimants whose income is truly irregular can only take advantage of the one work allowance in assessment periods when they receive that income.  That does not justify refusing to put right the problem that has arisen for the Respondents.  A properly drafted, narrow exception or amendment would not in my judgment generate legitimate calls from those in quite different circumstances for an exception to be made in their case also. </p>

The automation of the process is an important advantage of the universal credit regime over the legacy benefits system for a number of reasons. First, it generates substantial savings in the costs of administration thereby releasing more money to be paid out in benefits.  Secondly, it enables the amount awarded to respond immediately to changes in circumstances; a payment made seven days after the end of the assessment period can take into account any changes reported by the claimant during that assessment period.  Thirdly, the overall move to digitisation prompts claimants to develop skills which enable them to access other online services which they might previously have been reluctant to use. This may itself be a way of reducing poverty, for example enabling access to cheaper online services offered by utilities.  In order to achieve that objective it requires simple and automatic processes.   </p>

It would also result in a delay to the rollout of universal credit nationwide, undermining the social policy goals that underpin the reform.  Ms McMahon says that it is not possible for there to be an automated change to address this particular issue; the changes needed to solve this problem would “require a new version of the calculator to be essentially rebuilt from scratch”.  This would be hugely demanding in terms of resources and cost. The lowest amount this would cost she estimates would be about £7.35 million without taking into account lost savings arising from the delayed implementation of universal credit.  An alternative to completely rebuilding the calculator would be for there to be a manual intervention to resolve the problem for each claimant affected. A single manual intervention of this type would take about 1.5 hours of agent time and given the complexity of the exercise would have a higher risk of error. The intervention would only work for as long as the claimant stayed in that particular job with that particular payment cycle.  Changing job or employer could create further problems.  </heading>

Ms McMahon criticised each of these in her witness statement explaining why an exception along the lines of an existing provision could not be transposed to deal with this problem or explaining that an existing provision that seemed to require a manual intervention was acceptable because it related to only a few claimants rather than the many thousands in the same position as the Respondents.   </p>

Much of the evidence lodged by the SSWP assumes that what would be needed would be a wholesale move away from automation and a return to the former method of manual calculation by DWP officers.  I do not see that that is inevitable.  There is no difficulty in identifying a person who is in receipt of monthly salary payments on a date which coincides with the end of their assessment period.  The occurrence of the non-banking day salary shift is entirely predictable because we know for the foreseeable future when the last day of the month will fall on a weekend or on a bank holiday.  Even Easter, the most moveable feast, can be calculated for decades ahead.  There may be occasional changes such as occurred this year when the early May Bank Holiday was moved from 4 May to 8 May 2020.  If the only time that the Respondents encountered this problem was when such a shift coincided with the end of their assessment period I doubt they would have been prompted to litigate the matter.  If the claimant is not employed by an RTI employer then regulation 61(1) in any event contemplates selfreporting in response to requests for information from the SSWP.  There must be ways of verifying the information that is already reported by all those falling within regulation 61(1).  As for creating scope for people to manipulate their payments, the Respondents have given realistic counter examples of ways in which people could manipulate their payments taking advantage of the existing system to increase their universal credit entitlement during months when they appear to have no salary.  </heading>

Taking full account of all the SSWP’s evidence and bearing in mind Mr Brown’s warning, I cannot accept that the programme cannot be modified to ensure that the computer can recognise that the end date of a particular claimant’s assessment period coincides with their salary pay date so that if the latter date falls on a non-banking day the receipt of two roughly equal payments is likely to be the result of a salary payment being made a day early and the second payment should be moved into the next assessment period.

This email does not indicate to me that the Minister was, at that stage at least, committed to an immutable system for assessments periods. On the contrary the email records the outcome of the meeting as being that although “As a general rule” assessment periods should start on the date of entitlement, claimants paid monthly should be given the choice to have the assessment period running until for example the 1st or 15th of the month “to align the assessment period with the RTI feed, i.e. their pay day.” It follows from this, the Minister went on, that at the outset of a claim by someone in work, there would be one assessment period that is shorter or longer than one month.  There is also a rather gnomic comment “We need to establish the impact of bunching pay days for in-work claimants operations and agree mitigations”.

It is clear that the numbers may be very substantial, possibly 85,000 claimants. The SSWP states in her Detailed Grounds of Resistance that when fully introduced universal credit will be available to around 6.5 million households, about half of whom will be in work.  Mr Couling’s evidence is that in the economy as a whole around 75% of working people are paid monthly, a proportion that has been growing steadily over time as the economy shifts away from manual labour typically paid weekly or fortnightly.  Ms Hargreaves’ evidence is that since 2008, the Institute where she works has carried out an annual survey asking its members questions about payroll operation.  Since 2008 there has been a steady decline in weekly payroll.  Monthly payroll has been the most common frequency throughout the 10 years between 2008 and 2018. Almost all employers surveyed ran a monthly payroll although some also ran other frequencies in addition. Further, the survey shows that by far the most common payday for monthly payrolls is the last working day of the month. That has remained consistent throughout every year the research has been conducted with other popular dates being the 25th and 28th of the month. Although this point is not covered by the survey results, Ms Hargreaves’ evidence based on her own experience is that the great majority of employers will make payment on the last working day before the contractual payment date if the latter date is a non-banking day. Ms Clarke’s evidence based on the experience of the CPAG in the welfare field is that a large number of benefit claims are made towards the end of a month as that is often when people leave jobs, receive final pay even when they have left a job earlier or when contracts come to an end. </p>

As the table in para 60 above shows, the problem arises in several months each year and will last throughout the years of the claimant’s period of entitlement.  The problem cannot be solved by a claimant stopping and restarting their claim because of regulation 21(3C).  That provides that where a new claim is made within six months of the closure of an earlier claim, then if the claimant continued to meet the basic conditions for universal credit throughout those six months, the assessment period for the new claim begins on the same day as the assessment period of the old claim.  Ms Woods discovered this when she closed her universal credit claim with a view to starting a new one with an assessment period which would avoid the problem.  She found that she retained her assessment period because her new claim was treated as linked with the old claim.  The only way to start a new claim with a fresh assessment period is to stop claiming benefits for more than six months, something which is not possible for these Respondents.  </p>

Ms Hargreaves’ evidence is that it is not usual for a worker to be able to choose the date or frequency of wage payment as it is commonly included as part of the employer’s standard terms and conditions in the contract of employment. Ms Stewart and Ms Barrett both say in their evidence that they approached their employers to ask but were told, unsurprisingly, that the employer was not prepared to set up and run a different monthly payroll just for a few employees. I regard it as unrealistic to expect employees in low paid jobs to have the bargaining power to convince their employers make an exception to their automated payroll for them.  </p>

All the Respondents state, and this is not disputed, that they were not alerted by the staff at the Jobcentre from which they made their claim for universal credit to the problems that would arise for them if the end date of their assessment period coincided with the day of the month on which their salary is paid. Ms Johnson’s evidence is that when she attended at the Jobcentre she was told that she should complete the application there and then since her legacy benefits had been stopped and there would be a six-week wait for the first universal credit award.  She says that no one warned her that the date she made the claim might affect how much money she received and no one suggested she should wait.  </p>

There have been many Ministerial statements to that effect in policy documents and orally to Parliament.  The Respondents cite a speech delivered by the Minister for Welfare Reform in September 2011, discussing how people with children and disabled people will be allowed to keep more of the money they earn before applying the taper which reduces their benefit award when their earnings rise. The Minister said that the system will provide people claiming benefits and those on low incomes with some certainty around what they are entitled to and how much they will receive. It means, he said, “families can budget on the basis of a guaranteed minimum income”. The evidence of Mr Couling on behalf of the SSWP also stresses that the objective of incentivising work, both as a way of alleviating poverty and as an outcome in itself, was a fundamental tenet of the new system.  </p>

That case concerned a judicial review of secondary legislation concerning access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.  The challenge was to the requirement that in order for a victim of domestic violence to be eligible for legal aid, the evidence of such violence must be less than 24 months old. Longmore LJ (which whom Kitchin and Macur LJJ agreed) identified the purpose of the reforms read as a whole as being partly to withdraw civil legal aid services from certain categories of case in order to save money, but also to make such services available perhaps not to the entire membership of most deserving categories of case (such as victims of domestic violence) but at any rate to the great majority of persons in the most deserving categories: para 41.  Longmore LJ rejected the submission on behalf of the Lord Chancellor that this was in effect a rationality challenge, stating that that would be to confuse the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>jurisdiction with the <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield </span>jurisdiction of the court when they are separate concepts.

However, my view is that this case is more properly characterised as a <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness challenge than as a breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield </span>principle. The latter principle is more appropriate where a specific exercise of a statutory power such as a rule-making power is challenged because it fails to promote the purpose for which the power was conferred.  There is no specific exercise of the regulation-making powers which is alleged to breach the <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield </span>principle here.

The evidence establishes in this case that there is a very substantial number of claimants who are likely to come to the same conclusion as the Respondents have arrived at, namely, that it is preferable in many ways not to work because they would then receive a stable, maximum amount of universal credit every month making budgeting much easier and avoiding debt; that the benefits of working longer hours or progressing to higher paid work may be outweighed by the increased fluctuations in benefit award, particularly if the benefit cap exception is lost; and that looking for a job where the salary pay date does not coincide with the end of the assessment period may take priority over accepting a job which makes use of the claimant’s skills and educational achievements or which builds on her previous work experience.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I start by saying that I recognise, as does Rose LJ, the extraordinary complexity of designing a system such as universal credit, and that it necessarily involves a range of practical and political assessments of a kind which the Court is not equipped to judge.  I also accept that in order to be workable any such system may have to incorporate bright-line rules and criteria which do not discriminate fully between the circumstances of different individuals.  (In that connection the Secretary of State’s evidence, and Mr Brown in his submissions, placed great weight on the objective of having as fully automated a system as possible, but the point would be valid even in the case of administrative systems that are not computerised.)  For those reasons I fully accept that a Court should avoid the temptation to find that some particular feature of such a system is “irrational” merely because it produces hard, even very hard, results in some individual cases.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">However, for the reasons which Rose LJ gives, that is not a sufficient answer in this case.  Non-banking day salary shift is common and entirely predictable, and its arbitrary effect on entitlement to universal credit is now well-recognised, whether or not it was actually predicted when the scheme was being designed.  That effect has a severely harmful impact, which they can do nothing to avoid, on very large numbers of vulnerable claimants.  It is not simply a matter of uneven cash-flow (though the impact of that can be serious in itself, as the evidence illustrates): more fundamentally, the affected claimants will receive substantially lower payments in absolute terms because of the loss of the work allowance for “double-payment months” (and potentially also by reason of the operation of the benefit cap).  That impact is not the inevitable consequence of the application of some fundamental principle of the legislation.  I of course understand that it is a fundamental principle that entitlement should be based on monthly receipts, however much a claimant’s income may vary from month to month.  But an adjustment specifically to address the non-banking day salary problem would not in any real sense undermine that principle: indeed it could be said to vindicate it, since the receipt of salary in the “wrong” month because of the mechanics of bank payment is purely factitious (unlike other kinds of irregular payment discussed in argument).  That is indeed clearly recognised in the HMRC guidance to RTI employers to which Rose LJ refers at para. 86 of her judgment, which asks them to record payments as having been made on the day on which they would have been made but for the contractual date being a non-banking day.  If anything, the present operation of the scheme runs positively counter to its declared purpose, as Rose LJ points out at paras. 100-101.  It follows that I cannot accept that there is no way in which an appropriate adjustment can be made without prejudicing the overall statutory purpose; and I agree with Rose LJ that there is nothing in the evidence to justify the conclusion that no solution can be devised without causing unacceptable cost or problems elsewhere in the system.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I am inclined to agree with Rose LJ that the relevant form of unlawfulness is best characterised as irrationality, though I also agree that it has echoes of the <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield</span> principle.  But ultimately these various characterisations are simply aspects of the fundamental question of whether Parliament can have intended the rule-making power to be exercised in a way which produces so arbitrary and harmful an impact on the Respondents and the very many other claimants who are in the same position.  I do not believe that it can. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be sufficiently apparent from what I have said that, like Rose LJ (see para. 107), I regard this as a case which turns on its own very particular circumstances.  It has no impact on the lawfulness of the universal credit system more generally. </p>
