	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">1.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>In this case the Appellant (“the Landlord”) served notices of proceedings for possession under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988 (“the Notices”) on the Respondents (“the Tenants”) on 7 November 2018. The Notices stated that the court proceedings would not begin until after “26 November 2017”. His Honour Judge Gargan sitting in the County Court at Middlesbrough held that this was an obvious typographical error, and that the reasonable recipient of the Notices would have realised that the intended date was 26 November 2018. He nevertheless held that the error in the date meant that the Notices were invalid. The Landlord contends that he was wrong so to hold. Patten LJ granted permission for what is technically, although not in substance, a second appeal because the appeal raises an important point of principle concerning notices under section 8 of the 1988 Act. As will appear, the position is complicated by two previous decisions of this Court concerning section 21 of the 1988 Act. In those circumstances I should express the Court’s gratitude for the assistance we received from counsel for the Tenants (who did not appear below) acting pro bono and at short notice through Advocate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">2.<span style="font-family:Arial"> </span>The Landlord granted the Tenants an assured shorthold tenancy of Ivy House, Streatlam, Barnard Castle DL12 8TZ on 1 August 2007 for a period of six months. After the expiry of the six-month term, the tenancy continued as a statutory periodic assured shorthold tenancy. The rent was £800 per month, subsequently reduced to £500 per month on 23 March 2017. The Landlord contends that the Tenants have failed to pay the rent since April 2018, save for one payment in February 2019. As stated above, the Landlord served the Notices on 7 November 2018. The Landlord contends that the rent arrears at that stage were £3,538.44. On 27 December 2018 the Landlord issued possession proceedings in the County Court. At a first hearing on 30 January 2019 District Judge Adams raised of his own motion the error in the date stated in the Notices. Having heard argument, he made an order giving the Landlord permission to amend the date on the Notices and dispensing with re-service. The Tenants appealed on the ground that the District Judge had had no power to permit the Landlord to amend the Notices. The Landlord accepted this, but contended that the Notices were valid despite the error in the date. These proceedings form part of a wider dispute between the parties, but it is unnecessary to go into that for present purposes. </p>

He considered that two earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal concerning notices under section 20(1)(c) were consistent with that approach. The first was <span style="font-style:italic">Panayi v Roberts</span> (1993) 25 HLR 421, in which it was held that a notice which stated that the tenancy would run from 7 November 1990 to 6 May 1991, whereas the tenancy agreement was for one year from 7 November 1990, was not “substantially to the same effect” as a notice with the correct end date because the mistake was not obvious. Mann LJ, with whom Ralph Gibson LJ agreed, had distinguished that mistake from “slips of the pen” such as “‘1793’ for ‘1993’”. The second decision was <span style="font-style:italic">Andrews v Brewer</span> (1997) 30 HLR 203, in which it was held that a notice which stated that the tenancy would run from 29 May 2003 to 28 May 2003 was valid because it was obvious that the latter date was wrong and the intended date was 28 May 2004.  </p>

Having done so, it should then be possible to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not the notice served under it adequately complies with those requirements. If anything in the notice contains what appears to be an error on its face, then it may be that there will be scope for the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Mannai</span> approach, although this may depend on the particular statutory provisions in question.

The notice in <span style="font-style:italic">Fernandez v McDonald</span> did not do but the notice in our case did. It did so by means of the formula.

I do not consider that it would be fair to the Landlord to allow the point to be raised at this late stage without allowing him to rely on the Letters. Equally, there is no prejudice to the Tenants in admitting the Letters given that they are uncontroversial and limited documentary evidence and given that it is not suggested that the Tenants would wish to try to counter them by any other evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this argument. As the Judge found, the reason why “2017” was an obvious typographical error is that, read in context including the explanatory notes, it would make no sense for a date earlier than that of the Notices to be specified. Thus the reasonable recipient would realise that something must have gone wrong. The reasonable recipient would be aware that a common form of typographical error is typing an adjacent digit to that intended. Counsel for the Tenants submitted that it is commonplace for people to type the date of the preceding year in early January, not in November; but that is actually a slightly different form of mistake, namely a failure to make the necessary mental adjustment. In my judgment the reasonable recipient would conclude that the person who typed the Notices had mistakenly typed “7” rather than “8”. Having mentally corrected that error, the reasonable recipient would conclude that 26 November 2018 made sense as being the intended date and would have no reason to think that the day or month were erroneous. Thus I consider that the Judge was not merely fully entitled to make that finding, but correct. </p>

Given that the date of 26 November 2017 was an obvious typographical error and that a reasonable recipient would have understood that the intended date was 26 November 2018, I consider that the Notices did serve the statutory purpose of giving the Tenants at least two weeks’ warning of the commencement of proceedings. (In the event, proceedings were not commenced until a further month had elapsed, but in my view that is an irrelevant consideration, because the Landlord might have commenced proceedings on 27 November 2018.) </p>

I should nevertheless record that I consider that the Judge also fell into error here. To be fair to him, however, he did not have the benefit of having either <span style="font-style:italic">Ravenseft v Hall</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Obsorn v Dior</span> cited to him. As discussed above, those authorities establish that, contrary to the Judge’s understandable view, the “substantially to the same effect” test applies to information inserted into the form and not just to the wording used.   </p>

The inter-action of <span style="font-style:italic">Fernandez v McDonald</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Spencer v Taylor</span> has understandably caused some confusion, but Arnold LJ has demonstrated that on a careful reading the essential ratio of both is clear and that there is no inconsistency between them.  The tenant succeeded in <span style="font-style:italic">Fernandez</span> because the notice said, unambiguously, 4 January, and the fact that that did not correspond to the end of a period was not in itself a reason why the reasonable recipient would understand it to mean 3 January.  The landlord succeeded in <span style="font-style:italic">Spencer</span> because the notice contained two alternative dates and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">the Court believed that it was clear from the notes on the form which of the two must have been intended.   The correct test is encapsulated in points (i) and (ii) at para. 39 of Arnold LJ’s judgment.  I would only add, as regards (ii), that there must be no reasonable doubt as to what the notice was intended to say: that is the formula endorsed by Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Mannai</span>, at page 768G.        </p>
