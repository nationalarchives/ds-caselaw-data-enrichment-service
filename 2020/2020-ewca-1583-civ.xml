Legal title to the Property was vested in the sole name of Ms O’Neill’s father, Mr John O’Neill (“John O’Neill”) from its purchase in March 1999 until March 2008, when he transferred the Property for a nil consideration into the sole name of Mr Holland.  </p>

In July 2012, however, the relationship between Ms O’Neill and Mr Holland came to an end. Ms O’Neill left the Property with the two younger children, and at a later date Shaun junior also came to live with her.

The first further hearing took place on 26 February 2018. It concerned the question whether Ms O’Neill was entitled to an “equity of exoneration” in respect of money which Mr Holland had borrowed on the security of 53 Worsley Road in order to fund the purchase of two further investment properties, which the District Judge had now found belonged to him alone. For the reasons given in a further judgment handed down on 14 March 2018, Ms O’Neill was substantially successful on this issue, although the District Judge found that part of the borrowed money and a deposit refund (together amounting to £26,223.81) fell outside the scope of the equity of exoneration, because that sum had been used to benefit the family rather than Mr Holland’s business.  </p>

All of the orders made by the District Judge are conveniently recorded in a single order also dated 31 July 2018.

As was submitted on behalf of [<span style="font-style:italic">Mr Holland</span>], the requirement is fundamental, because, as he put it, equity does not assist a volunteer – a shorthand way of repeating precisely what Lord Diplock had said in <span style="font-style:italic">Gissing</span> many years previously… </p>

I reject the submission that, by analogy with the modern approach to proprietary estoppel, there is at least potentially an overlap between the two issues that arise that abrogates the need to establish detrimental reliance. That is not the effect of the overlap approach, even in proprietary estoppel cases, but in any event there is no support for such an approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Curran</span>. Mr Charles submitted that where there was a common understanding, there would be a lot less reliance required in order to make good the entitlement to a beneficial interest. Again, there is no support for that proposition in the authorities that matter, being those I have referred to earlier. Those authorities make clear what must be established. The reality is that the claimant did not plead that she had suffered any detrimental reliance, and the Judge did not find that she had suffered any.

The legal principles applicable to the claim are those of the English law of trusts and in particular, in the kind of dispute between spouses that comes before the courts, the law relating to the creation and operation of “resulting, implied or constructive trusts.” Where the trust is expressly declared in the instrument by which the legal estate is transferred to the trustee or by a written declaration of trust by the trustee, the court must give effect to it. But to constitute a valid declaration of trust by way of gift of a beneficial interest in land to a cestui que trust the declaration is required by section 53 (1) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, to be in writing. If it is not in writing it can only take effect as a resulting, implied or constructive trust to which that section has no application. </p>

For all practical purposes, she was fully protected while the Property remained vested in her father’s sole name and she had continuing permission to occupy it. There may well have been a general intention shared between father and daughter that he would at some future date transfer the Property to her, or to her and Mr Holland jointly, either by lifetime gift or by will upon his death; but a generalised future intention of that nature cannot begin to ground an immediate beneficial entitlement under a constructive trust.

In other words, the question would be whether the provision of the purchase price by her father, in 1999, could be relied upon by Ms O’Neill, in 2008, as a detrimental reliance by her when seeking to rebut the presumption that Mr Holland was intended to be sole beneficial owner. There would be obvious difficulties with any such analysis, not least the fact that the purchase price was provided by John O’Neill some nine years before his transfer of the Property to Mr Holland, but at least Ms O’Neill would then be seeking to rely upon the payment of the purchase price by her father against the legal owner, Mr Holland. It would make no sense for Ms O’Neill to rely upon the payment by her father of the purchase price as evidence showing that <span style="font-style:italic">he</span> was not intended to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property when it was acquired in his name. </p>

On 3 March 2008, Mr Holland sent an email to Mr Batty, saying that he was currently in the USA and would be returning to the UK on 13 March. He authorised Mr Batty to sign the mortgage documents, exchange contracts and complete the purchase of one of the investment properties on his behalf.

Paragraph 15 of the particulars of claim then pleads that in the circumstances, and both induced by and in reliance upon Mr Holland’s representations, John O’Neill transferred the Property to Mr Holland on 14 March 2008 for nil consideration.  </p>

But the findings which she made, particularly when viewed in the context of the contemporary conveyancing files of Butcher &amp; Barlow, did not differ very much from the case which Ms O’Neill had originally pleaded. Instead of a transfer into her sole name, the original plan (as found by the District Judge) was that the Property would be transferred into the joint names of herself and Mr Holland. This was then reflected in the instructions which Mr Holland himself gave to the solicitors acting for him and Ms O’Neill, and that is what would have happened but for the problem caused by the fact that the mortgage offer which he had obtained was in his sole name. When this was drawn to his attention by Mr Batty, Mr Holland chose not to try to obtain an amended mortgage offer in joint names, but instead procured Ms O’Neill’s agreement to the transfer proceeding into his name alone. The end result was therefore that she had no legal interest in the Property when the transfer took place, instead of the situation originally envisaged when she would have been a legal co-owner presumptively entitled to share the beneficial ownership jointly with Mr Holland.

Mr Charles submitted that such a finding implicitly entails a finding of detrimental reliance, because it is that factor which makes it unconscionable for the legal owner to deny the claim to a beneficial share. That may often be so, but in the circumstances of the present case I am unable to accept the submission. There is much force in Judge Pelling’s conclusion that the District Judge failed to direct herself correctly on the law relating to detrimental reliance, and nowhere identified the need to find that Ms O’Neill had acted to her detriment in reliance upon the relevant common intention: see paragraphs 22 and 23 of his judgment, set out at [18] above. Furthermore, the District Judge nowhere discussed the question of detriment explicitly, nor did she identify the matters which in her view satisfied the requirement. In those circumstances, a bare finding of unconscionability, without further explanation, cannot repair the deficiency.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">An unusual, and complicating, factor of the present case is the role of John O’Neill, who (on the District Judge’s findings) was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Property at the time of the 2008 transfer. He was of course under no obligation to give the Property away during his lifetime, and it was for him alone to choose what to do with it. Unfortunately, his death in 2009 means that his intentions in 2008 have to be collected, as far as it is possible to do so, from second-hand evidence and surviving contemporary documents. In principle, however, there is much to be said for the view that the primary focus should have been on his intentions when making what was, at least ostensibly, a gift of the Property to Mr Holland, and asking whether <span style="font-style:italic">he</span> had acted to his detriment by transferring the Property into Mr Holland’s sole name when it was always his intention that his daughter should have at least a 50% beneficial interest in it. Since the case was not pleaded or argued in that way, I do not think it would be open to us to decide the appeal on that basis. But I record my provisional view, for what it is worth, that such an analysis would have led to the same result. The only reasonable inference to draw from the available evidence, and the primary findings of fact made by the District Judge, is that John O’Neill would never have agreed to transfer the Property into Mr Holland’s sole name without a clear understanding, shared by all three of them, that his daughter was to have a beneficial interest in the Property. After all, he had initially bought the Property in 1999 in order to provide a family home for his daughter and her family. The purpose of the 2008 transfer must have been to promote that objective, and not to jeopardise it by transferring sole beneficial as well as legal ownership to Mr Holland. On this analysis, the necessary detriment to John O’Neill would then be found in the making of the transfer itself, because he then put it out of his power to deal with the Property as he chose in the future. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The second matter concerns the grounds of appeal relating to equitable accounting which Mr Holland was given permission to pursue in the County Court, and which Judge Pelling did not deal with because it was unnecessary for him to do so having allowed Mr Holland’s appeal on grounds 1 and 3. Unless those matters can now be settled by agreement, the case will now have to be remitted to Judge Pelling for those matters to be determined. </p>
