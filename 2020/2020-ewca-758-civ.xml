It is divided into five flats, each held under a long lease, four of 999 years’ duration, and one of 125 years. The freehold is owned by 89 Holland Park (Management) Ltd (“the Company”). Each of the flats’ long leaseholders is a shareholder (or in the case of joint long leaseholders are jointly a shareholder) of a share in the Company.

Radford, the then freehold owner of the Building and the Site, had converted the Building into five flats with caretakers' accommodation in the basement. Each flat was let out on short contractual or statutory tenancies. By a transfer dated 10 December 1965 Brigadier Radford transferred the Site to Ms De Froberville. By that transfer (“1965 Transfer”) Ms De Froberville agreed within 2 years to build on the Site a building for which Brigadier Radford had obtained planning permission. The 1965 Transfer also contained a number of other covenants by Ms De Froberville. Those covenants were given by Ms De Froberville: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">The first dispute between the parties concerned the enforceability of the covenants, and the question whether consent could be unreasonably withheld. The dispute was determined by Mr Robert Miles QC, sitting as a judge of the Chancery Division. His decision is at [2013] EWHC 391 (Ch). He decided that both the Company and the leaseholders were entitled to enforce the covenants. The intention of the covenants was to benefit the owners for the time being of the Building. The entitlement of the leaseholders to enforce the covenants came about because of the effect of section 78 of the Law of Property Act 1925. He next decided that Ms Hicks was bound by the covenant. Finally, he decided that it was necessary to imply a proviso to the effect that consent (whether under clause 2 (b) or under clause 3) was not to be unreasonably withheld. </p>

The structure that she proposed was a single storey glazed building that constituted the entrance to two floors below street level. The Company, with the advice of experts, consulted the leaseholders and ultimately, on 20 November 2013, refused its consent. Meanwhile, Ms Hicks had applied for planning permission for the scheme. Although the local planning authority refused permission, Ms Hicks appealed; and on 27 October 2015 a planning inspector allowed the appeal and granted full planning permission.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">On 4 November 2016 Ms Hicks applied to the Company for approval of a revised iteration of her previous proposed development under both covenants. In support of her application she submitted the whole of the material that she intended to submit to the local planning authority when seeking a revision to the permission previously granted by the inspector for her October 2013 scheme. This material was extensive and extended to some 3 lever arch files of material. The letter of application stated that the submitted drawings were “the final and definitive drawings of the building, including construction drawings and specifications.” The revised development for which she sought approval consists of a single storey entrance pavilion, which is described by the Company as being a glass cube structure, located at the eastern end of the Site, leading to a subterranean structure that covers most of the Site. Natural light is provided by a series of skylights and light wells. The design is uncompromisingly contemporary and it is common ground that it shares “… none of the design language of the listed buildings of Holland Park …”. The planning inspector who granted planning permission described the entrance pavilion as being “more noticeable at night as a gently glowing glass box” that was “… a somewhat unusual feature”. The 2016 scheme differed from that proposed in 2013 by being smaller in overall size, a change from king post to contiguous piling for the construction of the basement, the incorporation of a birch tree to the rear of the Site and some other minor alterations. Ms Hicks submitted this material to the Company before applying to the local planning authority for approval to the revised scheme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">that of time. This is a case in which there are concurrent interests in the land to which the benefit of the covenant is annexed. Slade LJ’s observations must be read in the context of the case he was deciding. There were no other interests involved in the land which had the benefit of the covenant. His words should not be read as a statutory text. In my judgment, the essential point in <span style="font-style:italic">Cryer</span> was that the covenantee was not entitled to take into account matters that did not affect the land with the benefit of the covenant. In my judgment that is the real principle. As Flaux LJ pointed out in argument, if the Company is not entitled to take into account the position of the leaseholders, Mr Miles’ conclusion that they are entitled to the benefit of the covenants is almost worthless. Any other conclusion would also have surprising effects. Take the example of a building scheme, in which a series of purchasers in a defined area all have the benefit of a scheme of restrictive covenants, one of which requires building plans to be approved by the common vendor. It would, I think, be a surprising conclusion to hold that the person with the power to approve plans had to ignore the interests of the persons entitled to the benefit of the covenants. I understood Mr Rainey QC to have accepted that this was so; but he suggested that there might be some special rule that applied to building schemes and analogous schemes of management. But if the principle is as I have stated it to be, there is no need for any special rule.  </p>

The expression “successors in title” includes the owners and occupiers for the time being of the land of the covenantee intended to be benefitted.

The wider the connotation given to the idea of improvement, the more necessary it may be that the landlord should have his protection. In the present general decline of taste and manners, a shop-keeper, looking at the matter from a purely commercial point of view, may be right in saying that the removal of some beautiful casement and the substitution of a garish window or façade of false marble may prove an attraction to the public and so, from his point of view, be an improvement. It is most important that the landlord should be able to be heard to say that it may be reasonable that he should withhold his consent to the perpetration of contemplated atrocities. In the present case, as the photographs show, no such considerations could possibly be urged. The erection of a kind of Assyrian façade, appropriate to and possibly copied from an archaic heathen temple, may or may not be in accordance with the spirit of the age; it is impossible to say that, architecturally, it can be regarded as any worse than the sordid front, of late Victorian architecture, for which it was substituted.” </p>

It is true that the legal context was different, but it is difficult to see why that should matter on the facts of this case. The covenant in our case was a covenant between neighbours; and in my judgment a neighbour has a legitimate interest in the appearance of what is built next door to him. Approval under clause 2 (b) had to be obtained before making an application for planning permission. If all that mattered under the covenant was the effect on bricks and mortar; and the capital and rental value of Brigadier Radford’s interest, it is difficult to see why clause 3 on its own was not enough.  Clause 5 of the 1968 Deed contemplated that the Building Owner might engage an architect in connection with the approval of plans and drawings, which also suggests that aesthetics were at least potentially contemplated as being within the scope of the covenant. It is also true that the covenantee in <span style="font-style:italic">Lambert </span>was an individual (in fact two individuals). In that connection the judge placed some reliance on an observation of Neuberger J in <span style="font-style:italic">Crest Nicholson</span>. Having referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Lambert </span>Neuberger J said at [46] that it was fair to say “on the facts of this case” a refusal on aesthetic grounds looked unlikely because the approval would be that of a company. Neuberger J gave no reasons for that observation. It may be that Neuberger J had some special feature of the case in mind. It seems counter-intuitive to deny that, in principle, a corporation can make aesthetic judgments, given that many major corporations spend huge sums of money on corporate and product design. The purpose of such expenditure may be to attract increased custom, but the choices nevertheless are aesthetic choices. In addition, it would, I think, be irrational to say that if an interest was held by a partnership aesthetic judgments were open to it, but that if that interest was held by a corporation or an LLP aesthetics were forbidden territory. Moreover, what the judge appears to have forgotten is that in our case the covenantee (Brigadier Radford) was also an individual. </p>

As and when the tenancies fell in, he would have been entitled to turn the flats to account, either by reletting them; or by selling them; or by living in one or more of them himself.

I referred to a number of authorities (including <span style="font-style:italic">Lambert v Woolworth</span>) which had not been cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Iqbal v Thakrar</span>, and held that detriment to a landlord’s trading interests in his capacity as a neighbour were potentially relevant grounds for refusal of consent to alterations. I remain of that view. In my judgment relevant “property interests” in connection with a covenant of this kind go further than a mere interest in bricks and mortar or the capital or rental value of property. As well as trading interests, they would include the amenity value of the right to enjoy the property in question. It is probable, in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Cryer</span>, that in the case of a restrictive covenant affecting freehold land a covenantee’s broader interests are confined to land to which the benefit of the covenant is annexed, but that would not in my judgment preclude the Company from having regard to broader interests in the Building. In the context of the discharge and modification of restrictive covenants under section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 the Lands Tribunal (and now the Upper Tribunal) has always taken a broad view of what amounts to a “practical benefit” secured by a restrictive covenant. </p>

The letter of refusal presents a rational case; but rational is not necessarily the same as reasonable. Apart from Mr Rainey QC’s general submission that it was impossible to evaluate an aesthetic objection, the question what might be appropriate criteria for that evaluation was not fully explored in argument. I am inclined to agree with him that merely to say that the proposed building is not to the taste of the Company or the leaseholders would be entirely subjective; and would not be enough. On the other hand, to limit aesthetic objections to a case in which there is an effect on capital or rental value is too narrow. As <span style="font-style:italic">Cryer</span> shows, an objection that a proposal is “out of keeping” or that it would have “a potential adverse effect upon the amenities” of the land with the benefit of the covenant may be enough. <span style="font-style:italic">Lambert</span> shows that the current state of the land may also be a relevant consideration.

On analysis the Capita report identifies a series of enquiries that might reasonably be made in order to allay all reasonable fears of harm prior to the commencement of construction but suggest that at worst there is a risk of physical damage to the structure of 89HP. There is not a hint that there is any risk of severe damage. Although it suggests that cracking might be greater than slight it does not venture an opinion as to what cracking might be experienced. The expert witnesses are agreed that on the assumption that the settlement figures relied on by the claimant in her presentation and accepted at face value by Capita are correct then Capita's concerns about more extensive cracking are misplaced. A fair reading of Capita's report (unless it was decided to return to Capita for further information) is that there were no reasonable grounds for refusing or withholding approval under clause 2(b) knowing that (a) the claimant would have to apply for planning permission (b) would probably have to obtain a party wall agreement or award and (c) would have to present definitive plans and specifications for approval under clause 3 before any building work could commence. In that context the dispute concerning frequency of monitoring and the setting of amber and red parameters could be resolved.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Rainey QC supported the judge’s interpretation of the two covenants. Approval under clause 2 (b) is the prelude to the making of an application for planning permission. The grant of consent under that clause does not entitle Ms Hicks to build anything: she still needs approval under clause 3. Although Ms Hicks applied simultaneously for approval under both covenants, the fact remains that they are directed to different ends. On the basis of the judge’s detailed findings, none of the detailed constructional issues needed to be resolved before an application for planning permission could be made. They could all await stage two in the overall process: namely the approval of definitive plans, specifications and drawings under clause 3. The mere fact that a single application was made for approval under both covenants based on the same material did not entail that the outcome of each application would be the same. I accept this submission. </p>

If the decision-maker has only one opportunity to give or refuse consent, then he may well be entitled to withhold or refuse consent if insufficient information is given to him. But in this case, the Company’s consent is required at both stages. The judge approached the question whether sufficient information had been given as a question of fact and degree.
