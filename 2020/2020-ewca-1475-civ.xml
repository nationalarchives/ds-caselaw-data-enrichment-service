	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Five appeals have been brought against a judgment of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (Roth J, Fancourt J and Hodge Malek QC) (‘the CAT’) on a preliminary issue arising in seven damages claims brought in the CAT by the Respondents.  The damages claims are ‘follow-on’ claims - following on, that is, from the infringement decision adopted by the European Commission on 19 July 2016 in Case AT.39824 – <span style="font-style:italic">Trucks </span>(‘the Decision’).  The Appellants are truck manufacturers, some of which were addressees of the Decision. The Decision found that the addressees had infringed the competition rules by participating in a long running infringement of the competition rules. The Decision was adopted in accordance with the settlement procedure laid down by Article 10(a) of Regulation (EC) No 773/2004.  The settlement procedure applies where parties admit the infringement alleged against them following the initiation of an investigation by the Commission and may be rewarded with a 10% reduction in their fines in return for settling the case. This reduction in fine reflects the fact that their admissions mean that the Commission can carry out a much shorter investigation and adopt a more limited decision than would be needed if the infringement allegations were fully contested by the participants.  The addressees took advantage of that procedure, admitted their involvement in the infringement described in the Decision and received the 10% reduction in fine.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Respondents, who are the claimants in the actions before the CAT, all bought or leased trucks made by the Appellants during the period when the infringement was in operation according to the Decision. They now claim compensation alleging that the prices they paid for those trucks were artificially inflated by the Appellants’ unlawful conduct. The question raised by these appeals is whether it is an abuse of process for the Appellants, in defending the follow-on damages claims brought in the CAT, to put the Respondents to proof of facts that are set out in the Decision and which the addressees admitted in order to settle the investigation into their infringing conduct by the Commission.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The CAT’s judgment on this preliminary issue was handed down on 4 March 2020 ([2020] CAT 7). The CAT held that in certain circumstances it would be an abuse of process for the Appellants to seek to contest facts set out in the Decision that the addressees had accepted in the proceedings before the Commission.  Permission to appeal was granted by the CAT in a separate decision of 26 March 2020 ([2020] CAT 10).  The Appellants’ primary case in these appeals is that there is no place for the English common law doctrine of abuse of process here because the question of what recitals of the Decision can or cannot be contested by the Appellants in proceedings in the national court is determined by EU law. They rely first on Article 16 of Regulation 1/2003 as ruling out the application of the domestic abuse of process doctrine in these circumstances. Article 16 imposes an obligation on national courts and national competition authorities not to take decisions which run counter to a decision either already taken by the Commission or contemplated by the Commission.  The relevant part of Article 16 for our purposes provides that: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“(1) When national courts rule on agreements, decisions or practices under Article [101] or Article [102] of the Treaty which are already the subject of a Commission decision, they cannot take decisions running counter to the decision adopted by the Commission.  They must also avoid giving decisions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission in proceedings it has initiated.  To that effect, the national court may assess whether it is necessary to stay its proceedings.  This obligation is without prejudice to the rights and obligations under Article [267] of the Treaty." </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appellants say also that to prevent them from contesting certain facts in the follow-on proceedings would be a breach of their fundamental rights of defence which form part of the general principles of EU law.  The CAT’s ruling also, they submit, operates to discourage those who have committed infringements from using the settlement procedure and so puts the United Kingdom in breach of its obligation of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (‘TEU’) by jeopardising the attainment of the objectives of that procedure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">If they are wrong in their main contention about the application of EU law and if the doctrine of abuse of process does apply, the Appellants submit that the CAT erred in the test that it applied and in the conclusions it came to on the application of that test to the facts of this case. </p>

Any such reference must be made before 31 December 2020 because after that date Articles 86(2) and 126 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community as given effect in English law by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 provide that such a reference is no longer possible.

The MAN SE group applied on 20 September 2010 for immunity from fines under the Commission’s Notice on immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases.  Three other Appellants later applied for and were granted more limited leniency and a substantial reduction in fines.  These reductions in fines for leniency are separate from the reduction in fines for the later settlement of the investigation.  Unusually, it was only after, rather than before, the sending of the Commission’s statement of objections that the Appellants asked for the case to continue under the settlement procedure.  Settlement meetings between each Appellant and the Commission took place at which the Appellants were able to express their views on the objections raised by the Commission against them. The Commission also provided each Appellant with an estimate of the fine likely to be imposed on it.  The Appellants then made formal requests to settle and sent in their settlement submissions.  </p>

The CAT dealt first with the question of which facts recorded in the recitals in the Decision are covered by Article 16.  Again, it is useful to pause here to explain what is meant by saying that a fact is ‘covered by Article 16’ in this context.  The parties rightly accept that the starting point for ascertaining which facts can be contested by the Appellants and which cannot is by ‘reverse engineering’ from the potential application of Article 16.  A national court must consider whether, if its judgment included a finding of fact that was inconsistent with a fact recorded in the Commission’s decision, that would mean that the court was taking a decision that runs counter to the Commission’s decision in a way that amounts to a breach of Article 16.  If it would amount to a breach, then there is little point in allowing the party to plead such an allegation at the outset of the proceedings because that plea cannot succeed.  If a fact is binding because the court’s rejection of it would put the court in breach of Article 16, then that is a fact covered by Article 16.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In analysing the extent to which the recitals in the Decision were covered by Article 16, the CAT referred to a number of cases in which the CJEU or the General Court has discussed the circumstances in which those Courts can examine the accuracy of recitals in a Commission decision.  These fall broadly into two kinds of case.  In the first kind, the Court is considering the admissibility of a challenge in circumstances where the applicant has in fact been successful in establishing that it was not liable for any infringement but nevertheless wants to challenge the Commission decision because the Commission has found that one or more of the building blocks for infringement were in place though not all of them.  Thus, in Case T-138/89 <span style="font-style:italic">NB and NVB v Commission</span> [1992] ECR II-2181 (EU:T:1992:95) (‘<span style="font-style:italic">NB and NVB</span>’) the Commission had found that there had been no infringement of Article 101 because there had been no effect on trade between Member States but the Commission had found that the applicants’ arrangements gave rise to an appreciable restriction of competition.

The attempts by the ‘winning’ party then to bring an action in the General Court to overturn those parts of the Commission decision that it did not like were dismissed as inadmissible.  The reason why such a challenge by the addressee of the decision is inadmissible was explained by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands</span>: </p>

For example, in Case T61/99 <span style="font-style:italic">Adriatica di Navigazione SpA v Commission</span> (EU:T:2003:335) the recitals stated that the applicant was involved in a single infringement covering two sets of routes whereas the operative part referred to it as having been a party only on one set.  The General Court held that this should not lead to an annulment of the decision since it was the narrower infringement set out in the operative part that was important. Conversely, in Case T-9/11 <span style="font-style:italic">Air Canada v Commission</span> (EU:T:2015:994) the General Court did annul an infringement decision because of inconsistencies between the operative part and the facts set out in the recitals.  More recently in Case T-105/17 <span style="font-style:italic">HSBC Holdings plc v Commission</span> (EU:T:2019:675) the General Court found that some of the factual findings made in the decision against HSBC were incorrect but that they did not affect the lawfulness of the finding of infringement because there was sufficient evidence even without the material contained in those recitals.   </p>

First, recitals can be relied on as an aid to interpretation if the operative part of the decision is ambiguous.  A recital which performs that function is ‘binding’ in the sense that when deciding whether a potential outcome of the litigation would run counter to the Commission decision, the operative part must be interpreted in the light of that recital.  Secondly, and more significant for these appeals, a recital which affects the substance of what is decided in the operative part or which constitutes the “essential basis” or provides “necessary support” for the operative part is also capable of challenge: [58]. Those phrases, both of which are found in the CJEU’s judgments, mean the same thing.  Finally, a recital can be essential or necessary if it affects the amount of the fine rather than the finding of infringement.  </p>

That test requires the sifting of facts into those which form the essential basis of or necessary support for the decision (‘essential facts’) and those which do not (‘nonessential facts’).  An essential fact is therefore a fact which is covered by Article 16 and is therefore binding in the sense that, because it would put the national court in breach of Article 16 if it were to reject that fact, the party is precluded from contradicting the fact in its pleaded case.  A non-essential fact is a fact which is recorded in a decision but which could properly be rejected by the national court without putting the court in breach of Article 16 so that the party is not precluded, for that reason at least, from denying or not admitting it.  </p>

The conclusions were then summarised in [148].  For example, in relation to recital (52) describing the meetings at Headquarter-level, the CAT held (see [82(b)], [83] and [148(c)]) that the findings in that recital that there had been a meeting on 6 April 1998 attended by representatives of the Headquarters of all the addressees at which they agreed certain things were essential to the infringement decision and so covered by Article 16.  That meeting could not therefore be denied or not admitted by the Appellants in their Defences to the damages claims.  However, the remainder of recital (52), in particular the fact of a meeting on 17 January 1997 in Brussels at which future gross list price changes were discussed was not regarded as covered by Article 16.  None of the material in recital (59) concerning the meetings at the German level was regarded by the CAT as covered by Article 16.

The Appellants fully accept that the facts recorded in the Decision will play an important role in the damages claims in a number of ways.  In addition to accepting the first part of the CAT’s judgment, they also accept, following the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Crehan v Inntrepreneur Pub Co (CPC) and another </span>[2006] UKHL 38, [2007] 1 AC 333 that the recitals in the Decision are admissible as evidence of the facts stated in them: see <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Lord Hoffmann at [69].  In addition they agree that the ordinary rules of pleading and evidence apply so that prior admissions are admissible in evidence and that a party is not permitted to plead a non-admission of a fact which lies entirely within its own knowledge. This latter point arises from the fact that CPR Part 16.5(1) provides that the defendant must state in his defence which allegations “he is unable to admit or deny” and if they are within his knowledge then he is not so unable: see <span style="font-style:italic">SPI North Ltd v Swiss Post International (UK) Ltd and anor</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 7, [2019] 1 WLR 2865, [3].

The CAT records at [125] that the Respondents expressly disavowed any suggestion that it would be an abuse of process for an addressee to contest non-essential findings outside the context of the formal settlement procedure and the Respondents maintained that position before us. There may also be contested investigations in which certain aspects of the allegations are conceded by the addressee; for example the addressee might be recorded as having accepted the facts underlying the Commission’s proposed definition of the relevant market or that there was an effect on trade between Member States.  The question whether it might be an abuse of process for the addressee later to deny or not admit those facts in the follow-on claims is not a question that arises in these appeals.  </p>

There was a great deal of equivocation in some of the submissions made by counsel for the Appellants, seeking to minimise the consequences of their choice to follow the settlement procedure.  I consider the following propositions are clear.  First, it cannot be said that the addressees of a settlement decision accept that they have committed an infringement of the competition rules without admitting the facts set out in that decision.  What they admit is that they engaged in the activities that are described in the decision; that as a matter of law that conduct amounts to an infringement and that it merits the fine imposed on them.  Secondly, although the Notice refers to the need for the parties to set out the ‘main facts’ in their settlement submissions, any implied distinction between ‘main facts’ and ‘non-main facts’ is nothing to do with the distinction between what I have been referring to as ‘essential </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">facts’ and ‘non-essential facts’.  It cannot be, since at the time the settlement submissions are made neither the parties nor the Commission can know the ultimate scope of the infringement which is going to be described in the decision.  The reference to ‘main facts’ indicates that the settlement submissions do not need to contain an exhaustive description of every meeting, every participant, every document and every phone call of which the party is aware. Recital (4) of Regulation 622/2008 which inserted Article 10a into Regulation 773/2004 explains that the Commission has a broad margin of discretion to determine whether a case is suitable for settlement discussions bearing in mind, amongst other things, the “extent of contestation of the facts”. The submissions set out the main facts sufficient to indicate the nature and seriousness of the infringement so that the Commission can take a view, having regard to the information it holds, as to whether the parties are serious about settling.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">All those ‘main facts’ on which the Commission wishes to rely in support of its case are then what are contained in the statement of objections and ultimately in the Decision.  It is because only ‘main facts’ are included that the decision is so much shorter and less detailed than a decision following a fully contested investigation.  I do not accept, therefore, that the Decision contains some mixture of main facts and non-main facts and that only the former are facts which have been accepted by the addressees.  The Notice does not envisage that the statement of objections and the decision will include non-main facts, added in by the Commission but not admitted by the relevant party.  I recognise that the initial settlement submission is not the last word as to what the party is prepared to admit.  There may be facts alleged in the statement of objections or the Decision that were not included in a party’s settlement submissions. The party will then have to decide whether it will admit those facts as well.  If it does not, it will need to assert that the Commission has in effect decided, as is its right in accordance with point (29) of the Notice, to adopt a position which departs from an endorsement of the parties’ settlement submissions so that the settlement process comes to an end and the case proceeds as a contested investigation.  If the party does not trigger that mechanism then it has admitted that fact just as much as it has admitted the main facts set out in its initial settlement submissions.  Every fact set out in the Decision is equally admitted by every addressee unless the Decision itself draws a distinction between some addressees and others.  The CAT ruled that some of the facts admitted are non-essential and therefore not binding for the purposes of Article 16.  That does not make them any less admitted for the purposes of the application of the abuse of process doctrine.  </p>

They may conclude following further internal investigations into their own conduct that the additional allegations are true and that their settlement submissions fell short of what they now realise was the true extent of their own employees’ participation in the infringement.  They may be prepared to make the admission for pragmatic reasons even if they are unsure whether the allegation is true or are convinced that it is not true but conclude that the benefits of settlement outweigh any benefit to be derived from bringing the settlement process to an end by contesting that allegation. Those pragmatic considerations may lead to the admission of some facts that turn out to be essential and some which are non-essential facts. DAF stressed that the settlement procedure is emphatically not a forum for negotiation or the resolution of factual disputes between the settling party and the Commission: “the vicissitudes of settlement mean that in practice a party will normally accede to a decision while it does not concur with each and every fact found”: see paragraph 81 of DAF’s skeleton.  That does not, in my judgment, detract from the effect of the admissions in legal or practical terms.  The legal effect of the admissions does not depend on the subjective intentions or motivations of the parties and the national court cannot entertain subsequent arguments about whether the party really meant what it said or not.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Whether admissions are made for a limited purpose.</span> The Appellants argued that the parties to the settlement proceedings accept that the information is true for the purposes of the settlement process but certainly not for all purposes.  The CAT rejected such a contention at [130] and was right to do so since there is no support in the law for that proposition.  There is nothing in Regulation 622/2008 or the Notice to suggest that the admissions are or can be qualified in that way.  On the contrary, point (20) of the Notice expressly states that the settlement submissions must contain a “clear and unequivocal” acknowledgment of the parties’ liability for the infringement.  I reject the submission made by Volvo/Renault that the fact that the addressees are not required to make any public statement or give any commitment to accept the admitted facts in subsequent damages litigation indicates that the admissions are made for a limited purpose.  It indicates in my view that the effect of the admissions in national proceedings is a matter for national law to determine.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time the settlement regime was introduced the prevalence of follow-on damages claims in national courts was well-known and the significance of an infringement decision was also fully appreciated by the Commission and the drafters of the Regulation and the Notice. Recital (2) of Regulation 622/2008 bases the usefulness of the settlement procedure on the fact that “[p]arties to the proceedings may be prepared to acknowledge their participation in a cartel violating [Article 101] and their liability in respect of such participation, if they can reasonably anticipate the Commission's envisaged findings as regards their participation in the infringement and the level of potential fines and agree with those findings.”  There is no differentiation there between different kinds of liability.  If, which I doubt, the Commission might nonetheless be prepared to allow a party to settlement proceedings to qualify their admissions in that way, there is nothing to suggest that the addressees did so.  The effect of the admissions in the EU sphere is a matter for EU law and the legal effect in domestic proceedings is a matter for domestic law unless or until that is harmonised, subject only to the requirement that the domestic proceedings comply with fundamental EU principles.   </p>

Article 16 is directed at preventing the national court from arriving at a conclusion which runs counter to a Commission decision.  It has nothing to say about how the national court should deal with allegations which do not assert something that runs counter to the Decision.  It does not govern what can or cannot be pleaded in English proceedings beyond ruling out the pleading of matters which, if ultimately reflected in the national court’s judgment, would put the court in breach of Article 16.  The effect of the application of the abuse of process doctrine here would be that other findings in the CAT’s final judgment in the actions would also have to be consistent with the findings in the Decision even though that consistency is not mandated by Article 16.  I cannot see that it would “run counter” to the Decision if the CAT held that the non-essential facts identified by the CAT are also true. A domestic rule that has that effect cannot be contrary to Article 16.   </p>

It stems from what the CJEU said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands </span>judgment to which I referred earlier. The Appellants rely on the statement of the CJEU that an assessment made in the recitals to a decision which are not part of the essential basis for the operative part of that decision did not adversely affect the Netherlands’ interests and had “no binding legal effect such as to affect the interests of the Kingdom of the Netherlands”.  It could not therefore constitute a legal act open to challenge under what is now Article 263 TFEU.  I do not accept that those statements in <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands </span>and similar statements in other cases are authority for the proposition that non-essential facts set out in a decision can have no effect in domestic law. The statements were made in the context of a ruling on admissibility.  What the CJEU in fact held was that not only were the recitals about which the applicant complained of no legal effect but that “the decision” itself did not bring about any distinct change in the legal position of the Netherlands and had no adverse effect on them. This was because it declared the state aids to be compatible with the common market: see the arguments of the Commission at [12] - [15] and the judgment at [20]. Since the contested decision declared the aid to be compatible with the common market, it did not bring about a distinct change in the legal position of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  </p>

The case law relied on by the Appellants shows that the legal effect of both the operative part of a decision and the recitals depends on the context in which the issue arises and the purpose for which and by whom that legal effect is being asserted.  The effect of them has to be considered in context, whether that context is another aspect of EU law or of domestic law.  </p>

The judge there addressed the question of whether recitals in a decision are binding and stated that a recital not constituting part of the essential basis for the decision is not binding on the court.  I agree with the reasons given by the CAT at [118] as to why those remarks do not take the matter further.  First, the Commission decision on which the claimants sought to rely in <span style="font-style:italic">BritNed</span> was not a settlement decision and the non-essential facts had not been admitted by the addressees.

It would create a patchwork result with some national courts treating all nonessential facts as contestable and others treating some non-essential facts as binding on the addressee.  I accept that there will be that lack of uniformity and that the CAT noted at [3] that well over a thousand claims for damages following on from the Decision have been brought in various Member States.  But I agree with the reasons given by the CAT for rejecting this argument at [145]. Any lack of uniformity is a consequence of the absence of comprehensive harmonisation of the rules that national courts apply when handling follow-on damages claims.  Early on in its consideration of the exercise of the victims’ directly effective rights to claim damages for competition law infringements, the CJEU recognised that the national courts are entitled to apply their own rules in areas which have not been harmonised by EU legislation: see for example Case C-453/99 <span style="font-style:italic">Courage Ltd v Crehan </span>[2002] QB 507 at [29]: </p>

The Damages Directive is now an important instrument by which that balance is struck.  Recital (6) states that  both private and public enforcement are tools which are required to interact to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the competition rules.  It is necessary to regulate the coordination of them in a coherent manner.  Recital (7) notes that the marked differences between the rules in Member States governing actions for damages leading to uncertainty and creating an uneven playing field.  How does the Damages Directive strike that balance?  Article 6 requires the Member States to confer virtually complete protection from disclosure on leniency statements and settlement submissions.  That is explained in recital (26) as being necessary to “ensure undertakings’ continued willingness to approach competition authorities voluntarily with leniency statements or settlement submissions”.  Nothing in the Damages Directive states that the admitted facts recorded in the published decision are to be afforded any protection or, more broadly, that whistle-blowers or settling addressees are immune or protected in any way from private actions. That is how far the EU legislature thought it was appropriate to go to support the aim of the leniency and settlement regimes.</p>

The brevity of the decision in many cases creates an obstacle for future damages claimants because there is less detail about the infringement and much less information about the effects of the cartel on prices.  Although cartel cases are always ‘object’ infringement cases so that the Commission does not need to establish effect for the purposes of infringement, there is often useful material in a contested decision about the effect of the cartel in the context of justifying the amount of the fine.  One of the factors relevant to the size of the fine is the gravity of the infringement, including whether or not the infringement has been implemented.  Because the addressees to a settlement decision have already indicated that they will accept the level of fine proposed, the decision does not include anything about implementation.  </p>

Daimler argued in its written submissions that the CAT’s approach is likely to result in settlement proceedings becoming lengthier and more protracted due to uncertainty about what may or may not be binding in later national proceedings. That seems unlikely to be a significant factor since no addressee could be confident at the time the admissions are made as to what will end up being an essential fact or a non-essential fact in the infringement decision.  Daimler also point out that there is a benefit to the claimants in the addressees using the settlement procedure because the Decision is adopted much more quickly than a fully contested decision and there is unlikely to be any appeal to the General Court.  That is of course true, but the factors that speed up or slow down the progress of follow-on actions once the infringement proceedings are closed are many and varied.  It is not inevitable that the speed of adoption of the decision will translate into a quicker disposal of the damages claims.  </p>

This envisages a situation in which an Appellant could argue that it should be permitted to contest a finding recorded in the Decision because that finding was inconsistent with the relevant settlement submissions.  It was not clear to me whether Mr Beard was arguing that it is not open to an addressee itself to waive the confidentiality of its own submissions or whether he argued that to put a party in the position of having to disclose the submission as the price of contesting a finding was equivalent to ordering it to do so.  In any event I do not regard the possibility of such a procedure as undermining the settlement process in breach of the duty of sincere cooperation.  </p>

Ms Carss-Frisk QC argued on their behalf that in order for the doctrine to be engaged there must be a ‘final decision’.  This requirement is clear from the speech of Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands </span> [1982] AC 529.  The appellant in that case had been convicted of murder at a criminal trial. He then brought civil proceedings claiming damages for physical injuries he alleged were inflicted on him by police officers while he was in their custody. The judge in the criminal trial, Bridge J, had considered and determined whether the claimant had been assaulted by the police as part of his determination on the voir dire of whether the appellant’s confession was voluntary and held that it was voluntary and so admissible. The allegations were repeated before the jury at the trial at which the appellant was convicted. The House of Lords, upholding the Court of Appeal, held that the civil damages claim later brought by Mr Hunter against the police should be struck out as an abuse of process. Lord Diplock described what is now referred to as a <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter</span>-type abuse in the following terms: (at p 541B) </p>

She noted that immediately after the passage cited above, Lord Diplock (with whom the other members of the Appellate Committee agreed) said that the proper method of attacking the trial judge’s decision on the voir dire was for Mr Hunter to include such a challenge in his appeal against his conviction to the Criminal Division of this Court. He had not done so. In those circumstances Bridge J’s ruling became final when the trial ended with the return of the jury’s verdict. His ruling that the confession had not been obtained by violence could thereafter only be upset by the Court of Appeal: 542G.  By contrast here, Ms Carss-Frisk argued, the non-essential facts recorded in the Decision are not capable of being appealed and have, according to the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands</span>, no legal effect. That means that only those facts stated in the Decision which are covered by Article 16 because they are essential and so can be challenged on appeal constitute a ‘final decision’ for the purposes of this kind of abuse.  We were also referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Linskills (a firm) and another </span>[1996] 1 WLR 763 where a claimant, following his release from prison, sued his former solicitors in negligence for their conduct of his defence in the criminal proceedings.

It is not right in my judgment to make the leap from saying that a non-essential fact cannot be the subject of an appeal to saying that it is not binding for the purposes of being part of a final decision which is protected from collateral attack in subsequent proceedings.  Article 288 TFEU provides that “A decision shall be binding in its entirety. A decision which specifies those to whom it is addressed shall be binding only on them.”  There is no distinction drawn there between essential and non-essential parts of the decision and no suggestion there or in any other legislative provision or judicial decision that only those parts of a decision that can be appealed should be regarded as binding. I have already explained my rejection of the Appellants’ reliance on the <span style="font-style:italic">Netherlands </span>case and similar judgments of the CJEU.

The issue there was which facts set out in an abuse of dominance infringement decision taken by the Office of Rail Regulation were binding on the respondent railway operator in a later damages claim brought against it. The CAT dismissed the damages claim on the grounds that causation had not been proved.  The claimant appealed on the grounds that the CAT had reached conclusions on the facts which had not been open to it because they were inconsistent with the facts found in the infringement decision. That judgment is of limited relevance to the present appeals since the ORR’s decision followed a fully contested investigation.  Further, the focus of the appeal was on the provisions in the Competition Act 1998 expressly dealing with the extent to which infringement decisions of the domestic authorities are binding in follow-on damages claims within the CAT’s statutory jurisdiction. According to those provisions, the CAT was bound by findings of fact made by the regulator unless the CAT directed that a particular fact should not be binding.  The Court of Appeal described that regime as comprehensible because: [50] </p>

However, if the finding is peripheral or incidental, on the one hand to question it may not involve subverting the infringement finding and on the other it may be fair and sensible because the undertaking may not have been concerned, for the purposes of the regulatory proceedings, to contest such a point, whereas if the finding is relied on in proceedings for damages it may have a much greater importance.” </p>

He also considered that “right-thinking people” would consider it unfair that Mr Simms be faced with a pleading which sought to import the tribunal findings en bloc. Mr Jowell also relied on a passage in the concurring judgment of Moore-Bick LJ at [168] stressing the need to be “particularly cautious” before finding an abuse of process where the parties were not the same in the two sets of proceedings. Moore-Bick LJ also concluded that it would not be an abuse of process for Mr Simms to contest the findings of the tribunal.

The CAT recognised at [121] to [124] that the doctrine applies only in an exceptional case and went on to consider whether this case was exceptional.  There was no error in the test that the CAT applied. This is not cast into doubt by the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Conlon v Simms</span> which was simply an instance where the court arrived at a different outcome when applying the test to very different facts.  </p>

Ms Demetriou rightly drew our attention to what was said by Thomas LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Aldi Stores Ltd v WSP Group plc and others </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 1260 about the role of the appellate court when reviewing a decision on abuse of process.  The Court rejected the suggestion that the lower court’s decision was arrived at by the exercise of discretion; although the court must consider many factors, there can only be one correct answer to whether there is or is not an abuse of process: [16]. Nonetheless an appellate court will be reluctant to interfere with the decision of the judge where the decision rests on balancing such a number of factors:  </p>

However, it is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to state that an appellate court will be reluctant to interfere with the decision of the judge in the judgment he reaches on abuse of process by the balance of the factors; it will generally only interfere where the judge has taken into account immaterial factors, omitted to take account of material factors, erred in principle or come to a conclusion that was impermissible or not open to him.” </p>

Those facts found their way into the Decision despite all the procedural safeguards and opportunities for second thoughts that are provided to the addressees by Article 10a of Regulation 773/2004 and the Notice.  In considering the answer to that question one must bear in mind also the [141] gateways which allow the Appellants to mount such a challenge to the facts admitted. The Appellants stress that this is not a case where the abuse of process doctrine is needed to prevent the claimants ‘being vexed twice in the same matter”, a factor that Lord Bingham described as part of the public interest underlying the doctrine  in <span style="font-style:italic">Johnson v Gore-Wood</span>. That argument is, however, an aspect of the exceptionality of the application of the doctrine in a case where the parties to the proceedings are not identical.  It does not of itself mean that the doctrine cannot apply in these circumstances.  </p>

To make the non-essential findings binding on the Addressees would be a breach of their right to a fair trial under Article 47, contrary to the presumption of innocence under Article 48, and a violation of the duty of sincere cooperation under Article 4(3). </p>

Follow-on proceedings are such an area. This is made clear, for example, by recital (5) of Regulation 1/2003 saying that the Regulation does not affect national rules on the standard of proof, and the obligations of the courts of Member States to ascertain the relevant facts of a case “provided that such rules and obligations are compatible with general principles of Community law”.
