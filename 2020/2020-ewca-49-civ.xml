On 22 May 2019, on the papers, I refused the Applicant’s application for reconsideration of that dismissal under (old) CPR rule 52.16 (which applied because the notice of appeal to this court was issued prior to 3 October 2016); but I granted the Applicant express permission to seek a reconsideration of that refusal at an oral hearing.  The Applicant sought such a reconsideration, which is now before me.  The Applicant appears in person. </p>

The Applicant failing to attend the interview, or otherwise respond, UKVI had refused the application for leave on the basis that the Applicant had failed to satisfy the criteria for a Tier 4 (General) Student set out in paragraph 245ZX(a) of the Rules.  In doing so, it relied upon paragraph 322(10) of the Rules which provided, as one of the “Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused”, “Failure, without providing a reasonable explanation, to comply with a request made on behalf of the Secretary of State to attend for interview”.  A refusal letter was sent to the Applicant at his given postal address on 2 October 2015 but, according to the chronology in the tribunal below (where both parties were represented by Counsel), that was returned marked “Addressee gone away”.  At the Applicant’s request, made after he had found the interview email on 13 October, it was re-sent by recorded delivery on 20 October 2015, when it was again not delivered, but held by the Post Office from where the Applicant apparently recovered it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:-0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">By the time of that hearing, it was (rightly) not contended on behalf of the Applicant that the notice of interview could not properly be sent by email to an email address given by the Applicant.  It was uncontroversial that the email had been sent, and received by the Applicant albeit in his email junk box folder.  The judge found that it was no excuse that the Applicant may not have seen the email which he had received, because it had been diverted into his email junk box: it was the Applicant’s responsibility to monitor that folder, and he acted unreasonably in not monitoring it.  In any event, the Secretary of State had said in his summary grounds of opposition that the notice was also sent by post, and there was no reason to believe that it was not so sent.  The judge considered that the return of the UKVI’s 2 October 2015 letter might reflect a failure of the Applicant to monitor postal mail too, although that did not contribute to the judge’s reasoning.  The failure of the Applicant to respond to the notice of interview properly sent to him by email entitled the Secretary of State to refuse the claim for leave, as he did, on the basis that he was not satisfied that the Applicant was </p>

It was a requirement of paragraph 3(3) of CPR PD 52C that a bundle of documents be filed including the judgment being challenged (paragraph 3(3)(h)).  Despite several reminders from the Civil Appeals Office, which indicated that in default the appeal might be dismissed, that judgment was not lodged; and, by an Order of 6 April 2017, Master Meacher dismissed the appeal.  The Order itself made clear that the Applicant was entitled to seek a reconsideration of the order dismissing the appeal by a Judge of the Court of Appeal but, by CPR rule 52.16(6A), any application for reconsideration had to be made within seven days.   </p>

Nor, still, did it include the challenged judgment of Judge Kopieczek.  The application said that the Applicant’s solicitors had been told that the Upper Tribunal “do not keep judgments more than 6 months old”, so that the judgment could not be provided.  That seemed unlikely.  Enquiries were made by the Civil Appeals Office of the tribunal, which revealed that no request for the judgment had been made until November 2018 – 18 months after the dismissal order – but, after that length of time, the request for approval when made had unfortunately gone astray within the tribunal.  As a result of the enquiry from this court, the request for approval was found, and the judgment approved by the judge.  It is now available. </p>
