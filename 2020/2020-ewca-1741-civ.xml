PSS is one of two statuses, introduced by the Government under amendments to the Immigration Rules, permitting the grant of leave to enter or remain and thus a right of residence in the United Kingdom, in a manner designed to protect the residence position of European Union (“EU”) nationals, living in the UK, at the time of and following the UK’s secession and the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. The amendment to the Immigration Rules is affected by Immigration Rules HC395, Appendix EU (“Appendix EU”). </p>

The justification advanced is that the exclusion is there to protect the social security system from claims by persons who are not sufficiently economically integrated into, or sufficiently closely connected with, the UK.

They argue that the judge was wrong to find that the discrimination was justified, and that he was wrong to find Ms Fratila lacked standing to bring her claim. On an equally short ground, advanced in a Respondent’s Notice, the SSWP argues that the judge’s decision should be upheld on the further or alternative ground that he ought to have held that the Appellants were not entitled to rely upon Article 18 of the TFEU. In essence, the appeal raises the same three arguments that were debated before the judge: (1) TFEU Article 18; (2) Direct/Indirect Discrimination; and (3) Justification. While point 1 arises only under the Respondent’s Notice it is logically anterior to the other two points. I will, therefore, address the issues, as the judge did, in that numerical order. </p>

A number of questions were referred to the Court.

Consequently, Directive 2004/38 cannot, as such, call into question the autonomy of the laws based on Article 10 of Regulation No. 492/2011 or alter their scope (cf. in this sense ruling of 23 February 2010, Teixeira, C-</p>

This is said to be all consistent with Member States having control of social assistance and domestic rights of residence; the Appellants’ case it was said, would lead to a right being conferred which would lead to a loss of such control. The right claimed would bring Article 18 of TFEU into the range of a residence rights that had nothing to do with the law of the EU and was not required by any EU law obligation (points 4 and 5 of the six points). The sixth point was that the Appellants’ contentions produce possible “adventitious results”. For example, under the old rules an EU national jobseeker would have a right to reside in the UK by virtue of Art 14(4)(b) of the CRD, but would be denied entitlement to social assistance by Article 24(2). However, such a national could acquire PSS and have benefits entitlement immediately on arrival.   </p>

It is perhaps not surprising that EU law should, in principle, allow EU nationals to take benefit from particular national laws of individual States if they lawfully reside in the State in question, without discrimination on the basis of nationality.

Lord Hope of Craighead (with whom Lord Rodger and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood agreed) said (at para. 26 of his judgment, p.794G) that if the right to reside test stood alone it would undoubtedly have been directly discriminatory, but as it was part of a “composite” test of entitlement, the other aspects of which were not discriminatory, the discrimination complained of, created by the habitual residence test (as defined in part by the right to reside requirement), when looked at overall, was only indirect and was, therefore, capable of justification. It was held that it was justified as having the legitimate purpose of ensuring that only claimants who had achieved economic and social integration in the UK, or elsewhere in the Common Travel Area, should be entitled to claim.

A resident student was designated as one who, at the time of registration, proved, first, that his principal place of residence was in Belgium, and secondly, that he satisfied one of eight other conditions, one of which was that he had the right to remain permanently in Belgium.

Unlike Ms Patmalniece, they do not complain about the imposition of a right to reside requirement (which she did not have) as a pre-condition of benefit; they have that right, and their complaint is that they are specifically excluded from the normal incidents of it by a quite separate exception to entitlement, applicable to EU citizens alone, if their leave to enter or remain is based upon PSS.  </p>

The question must be whether the exclusion of pre-settled status gives rise to a situation in which all non-United Kingdom EU nationals are excluded from making claims for Universal Credit. A rule that pre-settled status is a right of residence that does not count for the purpose of establishing habitual residence does not have that effect: it excludes only some members of the class of non-United Kingdom EU nationals. Other members of the class are able to satisfy the conditions to obtain Universal Credit: see for example, the effect of regulation 9(4), and the limitation on the exclusion at regulation 9(3)(aa). As such, the discrimination that arises by reason of regulation 9(3)(c)(i) is indirect discrimination, which will be unlawful only if not objectively justified.” </p>

It seems to me that they are right to submit, with respect, that, in this part of the case too, the SSWP “overplayed her hand” in saying in written argument that any discrimination in entitlement to benefit was regulated entirely by the CRD (Article 24 and the derogation in Article 24(2)) and that <span style="font-style:italic">Dano</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Alimanovic</span> indicated that the line of cases leading to <span style="font-style:italic">Trojani</span> were no longer good law. That argument was rendered impossible by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Krefeld.</span> The SSWP was thrown back upon the secondary argument that for discrimination to come into play, because of a right of residence, that right had to derive from EU law and not national law. I do not think that secondary argument is right either, for the reasons already advanced in relation to the application of Article 18 in the present case. The CJEU has not repudiated <span style="font-style:italic">Trojani</span> and moreover the Supreme Court here, in <span style="font-style:italic">Patmalniece</span>, has treated it as still representing the law of the Union. It is not for us to say otherwise. Accordingly, by direct application of the CJEU decisions, as interpreted in our own courts, a discrimination of the present type is prohibited by EU law and the question of justification does not arise. The case law leading to <span style="font-style:italic">Trojani, </span>and now including <span style="font-style:italic">Krefeld</span>, resolves the issue. </p>

Thus, for the purpose of the operation of regulation 9 of the Universal Credit Regulations the only persons advantaged by a grant of presettled status are those whose position under the EEA Regulations would not permit them to meet the requirements of regulation 9 as they stood prior to the amendment made by the 2019 Social Security Regulations. In this way the amendment made by those Regulations does, as the SSWP submits, maintain the status quo. More significantly for the purposes of the justification argument the restriction that applies to presettled status serves to maintain the prior rationale for the regulation 9 habitual residence requirement, as explained in Mr Malcolm’s witness statement.

In any event, I would also consider the operation of the regulation to be directly discriminatory because, as I have described, it has the limited and express effect of excluding a specific group because they are EU nationals. Finally, I agree with McCombe LJ’s observations, in paragraph 74, that a provision does not cease to be discriminatory because it affects only some, and not all, EU nationals. It remains discriminatory on the grounds of nationality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.22in">I note first that this is a claim relying on article 18 TFEU to claim unjustifiable discrimination against the appellants.  As is well-known domestic law has a statutory basis and has concepts of direct discrimination, which can never be justified, and indirect discrimination, which might be justified.  EU law has developed in slightly different ways as explained by Advocate General Sharpston in her opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Bressol</span>, in particular at paragraphs 43 to 49.  However, the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Bressol </span>implicitly rejected the analysis of Advocate General Sharpston explaining direct and indirect discrimination in ways which would have been capable of being equated with the statutory provisions in England and Wales.  The CJEU did not apply the Advocate General’s test for direct discrimination, formulated at paragraph 56 of her opinion, but found that the discrimination in that case was indirect discrimination because the provision was intrinsically liable to affect nationals of other member states more than nationals of the host state, putting the former at a particular disadvantage.  As this court is considering rights under article 18 TFEU, we have to apply this test for indirect discrimination set out by the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Bressol</span> at paragraph 41.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Patmalniece </span>at paragraph 30 the Supreme Court stated that “the approach which EU law takes to a composite test of this kind” was indicated by the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bressol</span>.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.22in">Secondly the legislation itself is, on its face, apparently neutral because it requires a claimant to be “habitually resident”.  A person is not habitually resident unless they have “a right to reside” (see paragraph 7 of McCombe LJ’s judgment).  Pre-settled status (“PSS”) is not treated as a qualifying right of residence.  It is apparent that the requirement for habitual residence is a provision which can affect UK nationals returning from abroad who, it was common ground in argument, would not immediately be treated as being habitually resident.  A provision which disadvantages others as well as the claimants is not normally treated as direct discrimination.   </p>

Claimants for universal credit who are British nationals are not in a comparable situation to the appellants in this case.  This is because they will not receive benefits such as those received by the second appellant, Mr Tanase.  He receives benefits from Romania, see paragraph 14 of the judgment of McCombe LJ.  It is not apparent that British nationals in other EU member states have been provided with any status equivalent to PSS and so there is no helpful comparison to draw there.  In argument Mr de la Mare submitted that the respondent could have created PSS to come into effect at midnight on 31 December 2020, when the transitional arrangements for the UK’s departure from the EU will cease, and he accepted that if that had been the legislative device used by the respondent, there would have been no direct or indirect discrimination because EU law would not have applied.  This rather suggests that there is no direct discrimination in the case of PSS as enacted, because the group of those with PSS such as the appellants is being created only for the purposes of the EU exit.    </p>

In this respect I note that if PSS could have been lawfully created as a status to come into effect after midnight on 31 December 2020, it suggests that these are decisions which it is lawful for the respondent to make. </p>
