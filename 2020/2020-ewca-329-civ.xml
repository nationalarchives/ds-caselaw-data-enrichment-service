	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Husson, a Mauritian national, was granted limited leave to remain in the UK in May 2016, with the right to work during his period of limited leave. A biometric residence permit (referred to below as a “BRP”) confirming his entitlement to work should have been sent to him within a matter of weeks. It was not sent to him until more than two years later. He sought to challenge the delay by an application for judicial review but was refused permission to do so. One of the questions he sought to raise on judicial review was whether the delay was unlawful and gives rise to a claim for damages. This appeal challenges the refusal to permit him to advance this case at a substantive judicial review hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The impugned decision was made by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge King (UTJ King), who refused permission at an oral hearing. His oral reasons were transcribed and approved. Subsequently in a written decision dated 17 June 2019 (which is worded differently), UTJ King set out his reasons for refusing permission, concluding so far as material: first, there is no jurisdiction to consider an action for damages for breach of a duty of care or breach of statutory duty in the circumstances of this case; and secondly, although there may be a cause of action for damages for breach of human rights, to mount such a claim it was necessary to establish a deprivation of the right to work altogether, which the appellant could not show as he had the right to work clearly endorsed on his passport. Further, on the evidence, UTJ King did not find it arguable that the appellant had established a prima facie case to support a claim for damages flowing from the loss of work.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant challenges these conclusions as wrong in law. First, in relation to the human rights based claim, Mr Russell Wilcox contends on his behalf, that there was clear evidence that he was denied any real prospect of employment since his passport was not in fact endorsed with the right to work, and there was sufficient evidence of consequent financial loss to establish an arguable case. Secondly, it was arguable that the unlawful delay could found a claim for damages resulting from the respondent’s negligence in issuing the BRP so late, particularly in circumstances where the appellant contends the respondent voluntarily assumed responsibility for issuing it within an agreed time-frame. Thirdly, by reference to the reasons given orally at the hearing (as set out in the approved transcript), UTJ King was wrong to exercise discretion against the appellant at the permission stage. If the application was arguable, it should have been permitted to proceed, and the decision to exercise discretion to refuse relief if appropriate, should have been taken at the substantive hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal is resisted. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richard Evans now accepts that the appellant’s passport was not endorsed with the grant of leave to remain or the right to work and that the passport was not a document which would have been acceptable to any employer as demonstrating the appellant’s right to work. Nonetheless, and in summary, he contends that in circumstances where the appellant no longer seeks a public law remedy as part of his judicial review claim, there is no jurisdiction to award damages. In any event, he submits the judge was both entitled and correct to conclude that there was no arguable prima facie case to support a claim for damages for alleged breach of the appellant’s human rights. Further, no arguable duty of care arose. Finally, </p>

Further, although a declaration is sought in relation to the unlawful delay, he submits that this is merely to further the only remedy now sought, which is damages and cannot be a public law remedy in and of itself. In these circumstances, and since the Upper Tribunal’s powers pursuant to s.16(6) do not operate where no public law remedy is sought, there is no jurisdiction for an award of damages only to be made on judicial review. He submits that conclusion is reinforced by reference to CPR Rule 54.3(2) which provides that a claim for judicial review may include a claim for damages, but may not seek such a remedy alone. Although it has no direct application in the Upper Tribunal, it is reflected in s.16 and applies by analogy. </p>

It seems to me that in the absence of a concession by the respondent that the delay was unlawful, the appellant remains entitled to pursue this remedy. Moreover, a declaration that the delay was unlawful is not academic if it is the foundation for a damages claim. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the appellant continues to seek a public law remedy in addition to his damages claim and the jurisdiction point taken on behalf of the respondent falls away and is not a good ground for dismissing his judicial review claim.  </p>

The letter should not have been viewed in isolation, and was indicative of the wider context in which the appellant found himself, effectively denied the ability to work, repay his outstanding loans/debts, or adequately provide for his young family. Significantly, Mr Wilcox relies on the fact that UTJ King accepted there may be a cause of action for damages for breach of human rights in certain circumstances, and wrongly concluded on a false factual basis that no such circumstances are present here in the absence of<span style="font-style:italic"> “a deprivation of the right to work altogether”. </span>As is now conceded, the appellant had no relevant right to work stamped in his passport.

In the present case, whilst Mr Atapattu’s ability to pursue his chosen occupation of merchant navy seaman was hampered, there is no evidence that, for the time in which he was deprived of his passport, he was unable to work at all. […]  Nor is there any evidence that the withholding of his passport had any other particular effects on the ability of Mr Atapattu to enjoy his private life, on his relations with other human beings or on his personal development.  Article 8 does not give a right to choose one’s particular occupation or to pursue it once chosen.

However, be that as it may, in circumstances where the respondent’s own policy documents make good this aspect of the appellant’s case in the sense that no employer could lawfully have employed him in the UK, it is an inevitable inference that he was deprived of all employment opportunities that were available. Moreover, the Prema Construction rejection letter (purely because he had no BRP) establishes an arguable basis (at the very least) that he suffered some pecuniary loss. There is also evidence of the arguably harsh impact this had on the appellant’s ability to enjoy his private and family life given the debt into which he had fallen, with the inference that he was unable to support his wife and young child. As for the fact that his debts accrued before the grant of his LTR, it seems to me in agreement with Mr Wilcox, that there was, again, at least arguably, an ongoing and accumulating debt, which coupled with the inability to earn a living to reduce and/or discharge it, or to avoid county court judgments being entered against him, made the impact all the more harsh.  </p>

Most recently, the decision of this court in 2018 in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police</span> drew together several strands in the previous case law. The case concerned the question whether police officers owed a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of an elderly pedestrian when they attempted to arrest a suspect who was standing beside her and was likely to attempt to escape. The court held that, since it was reasonably foreseeable that the claimant would suffer personal injury as a result of the officers’ conduct unless reasonable care was taken, a duty of care arose in accordance with the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Donoghue v Stevenson </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html">

The court distinguished between a duty to take reasonable care not to cause injury and a duty to take reasonable care to protect against injury caused by a third party. A duty of care of the latter kind would not normally arise at common law in the absence of special circumstances, such as where the police had created the source of danger or had assumed a responsibility to protect the claimant against it. The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire </span>was explained as an example of the absence of a duty of care to protect against harm caused by a third party, in the absence of special circumstances. It did not lay down a general rule that, for reasons of public policy, the police could never owe a duty of care to members of the public. </p>

First, the decision explained, as <span style="font-style:italic">Michael</span> had previously done, that <span style="font-style:italic">Caparo </span>did not impose a universal tripartite test for the existence of a duty of care, but recommended an incremental approach to novel situations, based on the use of established categories of liability as guides, by analogy, to the existence and scope of a duty of care in cases which fall outside them. The question whether the imposition of a duty of care would be fair, just and reasonable forms part of the assessment of whether such an incremental step ought to be taken. It follows that, in the ordinary run of cases, courts should apply established principles of law, rather than basing their decisions on their assessment of the requirements of public policy. Secondly, the decision re-affirmed the significance of the distinction between harming the claimant and failing to protect the claimant from harm (including harm caused by third parties), which was also emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Mitchell </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Michael</span>. Thirdly, the decision confirmed, following <span style="font-style:italic">Michael </span>and numerous older authorities, that public authorities are generally subject to the same general principles of the law of negligence as private individuals and bodies, except to the extent that legislation requires a departure from those principles. That is the basic premise of the consequent framework for determining the existence or non-existence of a duty of care on the part of a public authority. </p>

There are indeed several leading authorities in which an assumption of responsibility arose out of conduct undertaken in the performance of an obligation, or the operation of a statutory scheme. An example mentioned by Lord Hoffmann is <span style="font-style:italic">Phelps v Hillingdon</span>, where the teachers’ and educational psychologists’ assumption of responsibility arose as a consequence of their conduct in the performance of the contractual duties which they owed to their employers. Another example is <span style="font-style:italic">Barrett v Enfield</span>, where the assumption of responsibility arose out of the local authority’s performance of its functions under child care legislation. The point is also illustrated by the assumption of responsibility arising from the provision of medical or educational services, or the custody of prisoners, under statutory schemes.

It is in circumstances such as these that the courts have shown an understandable reluctance (as reflected in the authorities to which I have referred) to strike out claims as disclosing no reasonable (or arguable) cause of action, instead favouring leaving the individual facts of the case to be determined so that the evolution of the law can be based on actual factual findings.  </p>
