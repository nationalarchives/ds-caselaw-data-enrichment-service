Ockelton, Vice President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber), sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, by which he quashed the council’s grant of planning permission for development proposed by the interested party, Mr Steven Tavener, on land to the east of the Sun Haven Valley Caravan Park at Mawgan Porth in Newquay. The respondent, Mr William Corbett, is a parish councillor on the St Mawgan in Pydar Parish Council and leader of its Planning Group. The parish council was an objector to the proposed development.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">The application for planning permission was made on 11 October 2017. The proposal was described in the application as “Use of land for the stationing of 15 static holiday caravans and 15 holiday lodges, provision of access and car parking”. The development would extend the existing caravan site – a site of about 2.7 hectares, with 100 pitches for caravans and tents and 39 static caravans – on to an adjacent field of 1.6 hectares. The site is in the countryside, not in the Cornwall and Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, but in the Watergate and Lanherne<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Area of Great Landscape Value. The council’s decision to approve the proposal was taken at a meeting of its Central Sub-Area Planning Committee on 19 February 2018. Planning permission was granted on 1 March 2018. It was challenged by Mr Corbett in a claim for judicial review issued on 11 April 2018. </p>

The council did not misunderstand the policy, or misapply it. That the officer accepted there was a breach of it is evident in her report. But as she made plain (in paragraph 11), she concluded that approving the proposal would be a decision taken in accordance with the development plan “as a whole”, notwithstanding the conflict with Policy 14.

As the judge had observed (in paragraph 26 of his judgment), the relevant policies of the development plan were not inconsistent with each other – which would have offended regulation 8(4) and (5) of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012. Taken together, Mr Bowes submitted, those policies were “clearly and unambiguously” against the proposal – because of the acknowledged breach of Policy 14. That policy had been deliberately saved by the Secretary of State. And it is in unequivocal terms: proposed development “will not be permitted” if it “would cause harm to the landscape, features and characteristics” of an Area of Great Landscape Value. The officer concluded that there would be such harm. In those circumstances, as the judge recognized, Policy 14 had to be seen as a policy whose effect, “by necessary implication”, was to override – or at least to limit or qualify – Policy 5. The officer failed to see this. Her conclusion that the proposal was in accordance with the development plan as a whole betrayed a misinterpretation of policy. That was an error of law.  </p>

That understanding of Policy 14 would not only be an unrealistic and unnecessary constraint on the decisionmaker’s performance of the section 38(6) duty; it is also incorrect as a matter of construction. None of the policies, including Policy 14, is framed in terms that give it dominance over the others. No order of priority, setting one policy higher than another, or implying that one overrides or displaces any other, is indicated either in the policies themselves or in the accompanying text. Nowhere is it stated, or implied, that any conflict with Policy 14 will necessarily lead to a proposal being found to be not in accordance with the development plan as a whole, or to a refusal of planning permission. And in my view there can be no justification for reading words into Policy 14 that are not there, effectively excluding from the matrix of development plan policy relevant to proposals for “tourism facilities … and accommodation” the very policy that specifically relates to development of this kind – Policy 5; denying that policy its proper place in the performance by the council of its duty under section 38(6); and nullifying the support that such proposals are given by the plan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">How was the committee to resolve the tension between policy support for the proposal and policy conflict when deciding whether it was in accordance with the development plan as a whole? The answer is not that, as a matter of “necessary inference”, Policy 14 on its own, or together with Policy 23, dictated the outcome. Under section 38(6) the members’ task was not to decide whether, on an individual assessment of the proposal’s compliance with the relevant policies, it could be said to accord with each and every one of them. They had to establish whether the proposal was in accordance with the development plan as a whole. Once the relevant policies were correctly understood, which in my view they were, this was classically a matter of planning judgment for the council as planning decision-maker.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.29in;margin-right:0.00in">The main factors in that exercise of planning judgment were, on one side, the benefit of the proposal in furthering the aims of Policy 5 and, on the other, the extent and significance of the breach of Policy 14 and Policy 23. In her assessment the officer weighed those factors against each other, in conclusions that are not in themselves criticized by Mr Bowes. She concluded that the proposed development “would support economic growth and safeguard/create jobs in this rural area”, and “would therefore comply with paragraph 28 of the NPPF and policy 5 of the CLP” (paragraph 35 of the report). Having reminded the committee of the words of Policy 23 and Policy 14 (in paragraphs 40 to 43), she concluded that “the overall impact upon the Area of Great Landscape Value would be slight/moderate at a localised level which would weigh against the proposal” (paragraph 58). The balance between those factors is clearly struck in her decisive conclusion that “considering the proposal in accordance with the development plan and [the NPPF] as a whole”, she would give, “limited weight to the impact upon the AGLV as the views are localised and can be further mitigated by suitable planting and … greater weight to the economic benefits of the proposal” (paragraph 11) – a conclusion amplified by the recognition that it “… would result in a satisfactory development which would add to sustainable economic growth in rural areas and assist the local tourist industry” (paragraph 12). Put simply, therefore, the proposal’s compliance with Policy 5 prevailed over its conflict with Policy 14 and Policy 23, and, in the absence of conflict with any other policy, a decision to approve it was a determination made “in accordance with the development plan”.  </p>

He also referred to the decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Moore v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 1202; 2012 WL 4050191, where Sullivan L.J. said (at paragraph 27) that “whether the use of a dwellinghouse for commercial letting as holiday accommodation amounts to a material change of use will be a question of fact and degree in each case, and the answer will depend upon the particular characteristics of the use as holiday accommodation”. On the facts in that case, as Sullivan L.J. said (at paragraph 36), the “particular use for holiday lettings [was] very far removed from the permitted use as a dwellinghouse and a material change of use has occurred”. Mr Bowes submitted, however, that the description of the proposed “comfortable peaceful accommodation for families and couples” given by Mr Tavener in paragraph 10 of his witness statement of 9 November 2018 would fall within the broad concept of a dwelling-house, which is enough to engage Policy 7. In the Lower Sticker enforcement appeal, to which the parish council referred in its objection, the inspector had accepted (in paragraph 9 of his decision letter) that “[a] caravan used for holiday purposes falls within use class C3 and therefore … Policy 7 of the recently adopted [Cornwall Local Plan] is relevant”.

Policy 5 and Policy 7 have quite different objectives. However, as Mr Findlay submitted, on the construction of Policy 7 urged upon us by Mr Bowes, it is hard to conceive of any “tourism … accommodation” in the countryside of the kind supported by Policy 5 that would escape the restriction in Policy 7, though the latter says nothing about such development. This seems an unjustified reading of the two policies. And in my view it is incorrect. The policies may not be mutually exclusive in the forms of accommodation to which they potentially apply. But they can be read, and should be, without introducing unintended contradiction. And I think that in this case the council’s committee, in the light of the officer’s advice, was entitled to deal with Mr Tavener’s proposal as “tourism … accommodation” of the kind that earns the support of Policy 5, and not also within the reach of Policy 7.  </p>

The council did not misconceive the relevant policies of its plan, and did not apply them unlawfully. Its decision was clearly explained in the officer’s report.
