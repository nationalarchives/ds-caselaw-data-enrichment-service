Counsel who represented the parties at trial did not draft the initial statements of case and, although they may have had some input in the amendment of those documents, understandably, those documents were used as the framework for the amendments.  As I reminded the parties at the pre-trial review and at trial, the statements of case ought, at the very least, to identify the issues to be determined.  I recognise that a prevailing view may be that parties should not be held to their pleaded cases but it is unhelpful if parties proceed on the basis that the statements of case do not act as a limit on the issues to be tried.  I was left with the clear impression, by the conclusion of the trial, that, in many significant respects in this case, both parties, more or less, were advancing cases which were unpleaded.  <span style="font-style:italic">As it appeared to me that both parties encouraged me to determine the proceedings on the basis of the cases they actually advanced at trial, that is</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">what I propose to do</span>.

The “further contracts” referred to in the last part of that sentence concern claims which are not raised on this appeal.

He said that this required an offer by one party and an acceptance by the other. As he records at [238] and [251], UKLA contended that such agreement had occurred as a result of offers made by the LSC which UKLA had accepted. Mr Fryer-Spedding identified five offers said to have been made by the LSC. These are recorded by the judge at [238]. At [239] – [251], the judge analysed each of the letters or other acts relied on by the LSC and rejected the case that any of them amounted to an offer by the LSC. That was the end of UKLA’s case for an agreed variation in the MCV but, for good measure, the judge went on to consider whether, if any offer capable of acceptance had been made, UKLA had accepted it. One act by the LSC and oral statements made by the LSC were relied on by UKLA as constituting acceptance. The judge identified them at [255] and rejected both of them. </p>

UKLA contended that it was so estopped: see [260]. He was invited by UKLA as well as by the respondent to apply the dictum in paragraph [16] of Lord Sumption’s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">MWB v Rock Advertising</span>: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“The enforcement of No Oral Modification clauses carries with it the risk that a party may act on the contract as varied, for example by performing it, and then find itself unable to enforce it.  It will be recalled that both the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT model code qualify the principle that effect is given to No Oral Modification clauses, by stating that a party may be precluded by his conduct from relying on such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied (or reasonably relied) on that conduct.  In some legal systems this result would follow from the concepts of contractual good faith or abuse of rights.  In England, the safeguard against injustice lies in the various doctrines of estoppel.  This is not the place to explore the circumstances in which a person can be estopped from relying on a contractual provision laying down conditions for the formal validity of a variation.  The courts below rightly held that the minimal steps taken by Rock Advertising were not enough to support any estoppel defences.  I would merely point out that the scope of estoppel cannot be so broad as to destroy the whole advantage of certainty for which the parties stipulated when they agreed upon terms including the No Oral Modification clause.  At the very least, (i) there would have to be some words or conduct unequivocally representing that the variation was valid notwithstanding its informality; and (ii) something more would be required for this purpose than the informal promise itself: see <span style="font-style:italic">Actionstrength Ltd v International Glass Engineering IN.GL.EN SpA </span>[2003] 2 AC 541, paras 9, </p>

Moreover, the judge should have considered the possibility that an offer was made by the LSC and accepted by UKLA.

In such a case, the potential prejudice to the opposing party is likely to be significant, and the policy arguments in favour of finality in litigation carry great weight.  As Peter Gibson LJ said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Jones</span> case (at para 38), it is hard to see how it could be just to permit the new point to be taken on appeal in such circumstances; but as May LJ also observed (at para 52), there might none the less be exceptional cases in which the appeal court could properly exercise its discretion to do so.”  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case, there had been, as I earlier remarked, an 11-day trial with numerous witnesses and a large volume of documentary evidence. It was the task of the judge, which he fully discharged, to assess the parties’ cases and to make the necessary findings of fact in the light of the totality of the relevant evidence. As has been frequently said, the trial judge is in the best position to assess the evidence not only because the judge sees and hears the witnesses but also because the judge can set the evidence on any particular issue in its overall context. This is true also of an assessment of what a particular document would convey to a reasonable reader in the position of the party who received it, having regard to all that had preceded it.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">There are two principal steps that UKLA invites this court to take. First, it asks the court to expand significantly the documents and other evidence for examination to determine whether the statements and conduct of the LSC amounted to an offer which was accepted by UKLA, whether expressly or by conduct. Second, if a variation to the MCV was agreed in this way, UKLA submits that the court must determine whether the respondent is estopped from relying on the lack of a written instrument signed by the parties by a very broad enquiry, involving a consideration of all the relevant salient facts, the parties’ oral statements listed in UKLA’s skeleton argument for the appeal and the entire course of the parties’ conduct. UKLA also invites this court to consider its further cases, first, that by its conduct in continuing to teach additional learners after March 2009, it made an offer which was accepted by the respondent by its written statements and, second, that statements made by the LSC after March 2009 were offers which invited acceptance by UKLA’s conduct in continuing to provide courses to the additional learners. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, the investigations necessarily involved in these new cases demonstrate why UKLA cannot be permitted to pursue them on appeal. It would be impossible fairly to assess all the evidence on which UKLA seeks to rely without in effect re-hearing the case. The few documents to which we were taken by way of illustration are by no means unequivocal and that is even more the case with oral statements and conduct. Over a number of paragraphs in his judgment, the judge carefully analysed the five documents on which UKLA relied before him to determine if any of them amounted to an offer to increase the MCV. He did so, not just by reading the words of the documents, but also by setting them in their factual context, which itself was in dispute. The same approach would have to be taken by this court in order to assess the far wider basis for its case now put forward by UKLA. This is a course which would, in practical terms, be impossible for this court to undertake. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It would also, in my judgment, be contrary to the public interest in the finality of litigation and in the just and efficient disposal of civil cases for this new and greatly expanded case now to be permitted. It was the responsibility of the parties to put their full case to the court at the trial. The parties were then able to adduce all the evidence they wished which was relevant to those cases, to cross-examine witnesses accordingly and to make submissions addressed to the cases as put to the court. As the fact-finder and primary decision-maker, the trial judge was uniquely well-placed to make the findings and evaluative judgments necessary to decide the case. This is what happened in the present case. There is no reason why the whole process should be repeated, either by this court or by remitting it to the court below, just because UKLA now wishes to put its case in a significantly different way.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Darton submitted that the trial “went awry” because the judge thought, on the basis of clause 30.2, that there could be no agreed variation of the MCV without a document containing an offer. I can see nothing in the judgment to justify this challenge. He focused on documents because that was the case put to him by UKLA. There is no reason to suppose that, if it had also relied on oral statements or conduct, the judge would not have considered them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">both parties to decide the case by reference to the submissions made to him at the trial. The fact is that the judge extended considerable indulgence to both parties, in order that the case could proceed on a coherent basis which, he concluded, was not possible on the pleadings as they stood at the start of the trial. No-one objected to that course (and it is hard to see how they could) and it is too late to complain of it now. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I would add here that I endorse the view expressed by the judge to the parties at the trial and repeated in his judgment at [11] that the statements of case ought, at the very least, to identify the issues to be determined. In that way, the parties know the issues to which they should direct their evidence and their challenges to the evidence of the other party or parties and the issues to which they should direct their submissions on the law and the evidence. Equally importantly, it enables the judge to keep the trial within manageable bounds, so that public resources as well as the parties’ own resources are not wasted, and so that the judge knows the issues on which the proceedings, and the judgment, must concentrate.  If, as he said, there was “a prevailing view that parties should not be held to their pleaded cases”, it is wrong. That is not to say that technical points may be used to prevent the just disposal of a case or that a trial judge may not permit a departure from a pleaded case where it is just to do so (although in such a case it is good practice to amend the pleading, even at trial), but the statements of case play a critical role in civil litigation which should not be diminished.    </p>
