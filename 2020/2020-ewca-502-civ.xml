She attends a school for pupils with special educational needs.  The school is some 13 miles away from her home.  At present the Respondent (Leicestershire County Council or “the Council”) provides her with home to school transport in a mini-bus for an annual contributory charge of £660 as hers is a non-low income family.

In addition it takes about 10 minutes at each end of the journey to load or unload the Appellant, and to settle her.  In evidence which is before the Court her father explains that looking after his daughter is tiring, and is a full time commitment.  He is her primary carer.  His wife works full-time.  For now, he uses the time while his daughter is at school and travelling to and from school, to complete all other household tasks he has to do, both for the Appellant and her two siblings.  This time provides a form of respite for him.  In the event that the Council-provided transport is withdrawn, he will spend up to three hours each day taking his daughter to and from school.  </p>

At that meeting, the Respondent’s Cabinet considered a report prepared by its Director of Environment and Transport.  That report proposed revisions both to the Respondent’s Mainstream Home to School Transport Policy and to the SEN Policy.  The Cabinet resolved to accept the changes proposed, to come into effect from the beginning of the 2019-2020 academic year.  The Respondent subsequently (after the hearing before the High Court had taken place but before judgment was given by Swift J) decided to delay implementation of the revisions to the policies until the beginning of the 2020-2021 academic year.  </p>

Under the previous version of the SEN Policy, the Respondent commonly exercised that discretion by providing actual home to school transport to the Appellant and other pupils in her cohort.  Under the revised version of the SEN Policy, however, the transport previously provided by the Respondent will, save in exceptional cases, be replaced by money payments known as Personal Transport Budgets (“PTBs”): see the SEN Policy, para. 8.3.

Of relevance to the present case is para. 2, which provides that a child falls within that paragraph if he is of compulsory school age and is a child with special educational needs or a disabled child.  Since a person in the Appellant’s position, who is over the age of 16, is not of compulsory school age, the provisions of section 508B do not therefore apply, even though she is disabled and does have special educational needs. </p>

Very importantly, however, it should be noted that those provisions have not been brought into force.  Section 51, if it were brought into force, would make it an offence for a person to whom an attendance notice has been given to fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the requirements of such a notice.

On the facts of the present case, the Respondent has put in place an EHC plan in respect of the Appellant (issued on 19 August 2016) but that plan does not include transport as either one of her needs or as part of the special educational provision to be made for her. </p>

(4) having regard to all these matters and to the severity of the consequences is the difference of treatment such that a fair balance has been struck?

Applying that approach, at para. 40, Swift J held that the difference in treatment did strike a fair balance between the interests of the 16 to 18 age group and the general interest reflected in the provisions of the 1996 Act requiring home to school transport to be provided for pupils of compulsory school age.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first principle is the “margin of appreciation”.  Strictly speaking this is only a principle of international law and has no direct relevance in domestic law.  It is a doctrine which is used by the European Court of Human Rights to respect the fact that the Council of Europe has 47 Member States, with many different cultures, traditions and legal systems.  The European Court of Human Rights respects the fact that national institutions will often be better placed to make an assessment of whether, for example, a fair balance has been struck between the rights of the individual and the general interests of the community, since they have a closer understanding of conditions in their own country than an international court does or could have.  The European Court of Human Rights has frequently said that the scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and its background: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Fretté v France</span> (2002) 38 EHRR 438, at para. 40, which was cited by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2004] UKHL 56; [2005] 2 AC 68, at para. 39.  As Lord Bingham also observed in that paragraph, a similar approach is to be found in domestic authority: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex p. Kebilene</span> [2000] 2 AC 326, at 381 in the opinion of Lord Hope of Craighead. </p>

It is recognised in the jurisprudence both of the European Court of Human Rights and in domestic courts under the HRA that certain grounds of discrimination are “suspect”, in particular race, sex, nationality and sexual orientation.  These will therefore call for more stringent scrutiny than other grounds of discrimination.  In the terminology used by the European Court of Human Rights, “very weighty reasons” will usually be required to justify what would otherwise be discrimination on such grounds: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</span> [2005] UKHL 37; [2006] 1 AC 173, at paras. 15-17 in the opinion of Lord Hoffmann; and paras. 55-60 in the opinion of Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe.

That was a case which arose in the context of education and specifically in the context of the student loan scheme for tertiary education.  That scheme was held to be discriminatory on grounds of immigration status.  Two members of the Court (Lords Sumption and Reed JJSC) dissented.  They considered that the “manifestly without reasonable foundation test” was indeed applicable in that context: see paras. 74-79.  The difficulty in ascertaining the <span style="font-style:italic">ratio</span> of the case is that the majority was divided.  The principal judgment was given by Lady Hale JSC, with whom Lord Kerr JSC agreed.  She rejected the “manifestly without reasonable foundation” test: see paras. 27-32.  However, Lord Hughes JSC, who formed the third member of the majority of the Court, expressly declined to decide whether the applicable test was the “manifestly without reasonable foundation test” or some less stringent test: see para. 58.  Furthermore, I would note that even Lady Hale accepted, at para. 32, that, since the context was one “concerned with the distribution of finite resources at some cost to the taxpayer”, the court “must treat the judgments of the Secretary of State, as primary decision-maker, with appropriate respect.” </p>

I would note that, at para. 59, the Court was careful to say that it was not laying down any general principles, as it was considering “the very specific circumstances of this case”; and that therefore the Court would “have regard primarily to the applicants’ personal situation.”  In my view, the case is also distinguishable from the present context because it concerned discrimination on a suspect ground (nationality) or something close to it (permanent residence) and because the Court’s reasoning was clearly influenced by the societal interest in the integration of minorities: see paras. 52 and 57.

In that context it is important to note that a potential defence is made available by the legislation to those parents who are able to argue that appropriate school transport was not provided by a local authority to their child: see section 444(3B) of the 1996 Act.   </p>

This is not a case, such as might be envisaged hypothetically, where (for example) a cash-strapped local authority decided to adopt a policy under which school transport would continue to be provided for some people based on a wholly irrelevant ground such as sending boys by taxi to school but not girls. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of the Appellant Ms Richards complains under Ground 1(c) of the appeal that, although (at paras. 60-63 of his judgment) the Judge accepted a number of detailed criticisms of the Respondent’s policy, he did not go on to conclude that this led to a lack of objective justification for the purpose of Article 14.  She highlighted criticisms of the SEN Policy which Swift J noted “…ought to give the Council pause for thought” (para. 63).  These included the mileage rate in the Respondent’s “Ready Reckoner”, which was said to be arbitrary and entirely impressionistic (para. 60); and the lack of information in the SEN policy as to which matters might produce PTBs that were either higher or lower than the amounts in the Ready Reckoner (para. 62).  The Judge said nevertheless that these matters did not affect his conclusion on the grounds of challenge pursued in the claim, which he had already rejected earlier (para. 63).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">As Ms Richards fairly accepts, permission to bring the original claim for judicial review on grounds of irrationality was refused: see the order of Andrews J dated 21 February 2019.  She therefore accepts that she cannot directly rely on alleged irrationality in aspects of the policy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, Ms Richards submits that, since the Respondents’ own case is that one of the reasons why the policy is objectively justified is that it includes “safety valves”, the criticisms which the Judge made were relevant to whether those safety valves were such as to render the policy objectively justified under Article 14. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I would reject that submission.  In my view, the Judge was entitled to reach the conclusion which he did overall as to the objective justification of the policy under Article 14.  He clearly had in mind the specific criticisms which he made, albeit in another section of his judgment at paras. 60-63, but this did not lead him to conclude that the policy lacked objective justification under Article 14.  In my view that analysis was not only one that was available to him; it is the correct one.  This is for all the reasons which I have set out earlier when addressing Ground 1(a) of the appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For those reasons it is unnecessary to consider the additional or alternative grounds relied upon in the Respondent’s Notice save in so far as I have addressed the submission (which I accept) that, even if the correct test in this context was not the manifestly without reasonable foundation test, the outcome would have been no different.  In particular, I do not think it necessary or appropriate in this appeal to consider Mr Oldham’s submission that the present case did not fall within the ambit of A2P1 or Article 8 at all.  Those issues may call for detailed consideration in other cases in which resolution of them is necessary for the outcome; that is not so in this appeal. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, I would like to say only this.  One has a natural sympathy for the Appellant and her family but this appeal concerns a challenge to a policy and not to the decision taken on the facts of an individual case.  For the reasons I have given there is no basis in law for that policy to be overturned by the courts and therefore the appeal must be dismissed. </p>
