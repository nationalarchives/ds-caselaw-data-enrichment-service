His historical narrative, which is not accepted by the Secretary of State, is that he lived with his parents until the age of six but left home after he was mistreated. He says that he was found by a woman called Khuki who cared for him and brought him to London in early 2013. On any basis, on 20 February 2013, he was abandoned and was treated as a trafficked child who was placed with foster carers by the responsible local authority. </p>

As his period of leave was expiring, the Appellant applied for further leave to remain on 18 May 2017. His application relied in part on his family life with his foster carers and their family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Secretary of State refused the Appellant leave to remain on 12 December 2017 because he  a) had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution to qualify for asylum, b) had failed to demonstrate a real risk of serious harm to qualify for humanitarian protection, c) had failed to demonstrate that a refusal to grant leave to remain would breach his right to respect for family life under Article 8 ECHR or would cause a real risk that he would face treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR, and d) was not eligible for a grant of discretionary leave.  </p>

In his subsequent appeal to the Upper Tribunal (‘UT’), the Appellant was granted permission only in relation to his Article 8 case. He argued that the FtT had a) given inadequate reasons for its findings, b) defined family life too narrowly and contrary to authority and c) erred in finding that there was insufficient dependency. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The factual evidence relating to the Appellant’s relationship with his foster family that was available to both tribunals is important and I shall return to it later in this judgment.  It is important that I identify at this stage what it is and that it was not adequately considered by any decision maker.  The FtT heard oral evidence given in English from both the Appellant and from the carer who I shall call his foster mother because she asserts that quality of relationship in her evidence. There were witness statements from the Appellant and his foster mother, correspondence with the British Red Cross, evidence from the Appellant’s social worker and reports from his Children Services Department including, among other material, the statutory Pathway Plan made for the Appellant, as a young man leaving the care system for whom the state has continuing obligations. </p>

That is evidenced at pages 6 and 7 of the Pathway Plan and at page 10 of the same document the Appellant’s relationship with his foster mother is recorded as being: “very important and key to maintaining long term stability as she knows him and is attentive to his needs”.  </p>

The classic formulation of the principle is said to be this:  if a court concludes that a witness has lied about one matter, it does not follow that he has lied about everything.  A witness may lie for many reasons, for example, out of shame, humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress, confusion and emotional pressure.  That is because a person’s motives may be different as respects different questions.  The warning is not to be found in the judgments before this court.  This is perhaps a useful opportunity to emphasise that the utility of the self-direction is of general application and not limited to family and criminal cases. </p>

What is surprising is the lack of any analysis of the evidence which existed given the Article 8 case that was being advanced in the UT.  In the event, the UT found that there was no error of law in the FtT’s conclusion that family life did not exist between the Appellant and his foster family on the facts of this case. The deputy Judge was sufficiently unimpressed that he said that the grant of permission to appeal to the UT was “generous”.  With respect, I disagree with him.

I entirely concur with the import of his observation in so far as it recognises that tribunal judges are specialist judges who are expected to know the expert materials in their field such that an appellate court should have appropriate regard for that specialist experience.  That is quite different from an implication that there is a factor to be considered in an appeal that experienced judges should not be expected to make a mistake. In commenting that it “would have been an elementary and unlikely error for any judge in a jurisdiction which revolves around Article 8 ECHR issues” he was applying an assumption which is an inappropriate approach to an appeal. </p>

The connection is not a voluntary one, however successful it may be, but a commercial arrangement reached so that the local authority could discharge its statutory duties to the Appellant. The main financial support comes from the state, not the foster carers.” From this the deputy Judge reasoned that “the judge was entitled to find that there was no emotional dependency, particularly as the Appellant had not been found to be credible.” </p>

The Secretary of State’s submission is that in birth families and those families where relationships benefit from the status of adoption, the “blood link” or the fact of adoption goes deeper than the “mechanics of care” that might exist and hence arise out of foster care.

To describe foster care as a ‘commercial arrangement’, and to give pre-emptive weight to this starting point (as the deputy Judge in the UT did), is said to be reductive and to add nothing to the material analysis. The Appellant submits that, in having to prove the existence of family life before a tribunal, there should be no divergence in principle between the way relationships that exist in a birth family and those which exist in a foster family are treated.  The process of identifying family life depends on the substance of the relationship and not its form: it is a matter of fact-finding in every case.  As to which, the Appellant submitted that great if not determinative weight is to be placed on the fact of cohabitation, particularly where a young person continues to live with the foster family after reaching the age of majority.   </p>

The starting point for the analysis of a court or tribunal is accordingly not different.   The tribunal’s task is to assess whether the family life that existed in the run up to a child’s attainment of majority continues to exist afterwards i.e. based upon the factual findings: what is the substance of the relationship. The suggestion that the formal characterisation of a foster family as a non-voluntary, commercial relationship should impact on or alter the court’s inquiry and analysis of the existence of family life goes against authority to the effect that it is the substance and not the form of the relationship that grounds a family life. </p>

He has been brought up and cared for by a foster family who are committed to him as if he were a child of the family’s.  They are paid by the local authority children’s services department.  That department independently considers the foster family to be committed to his welfare and success in life. There is a Pathway Plan in place for him that provides for his continued cohabitation with the foster family until at least the age of 21, a settlement that both the Appellant and his foster family jointly desire. It may be significant that through the support, protection and upbringing of his foster family, the Appellant has transformed from a destitute thirteen-year-old who spoke no English, to an accomplished young man engaged in his community and education.  It must now be for a new tribunal to consider all of the relevant evidence afresh and come to a conclusion about the Appellant’s family life. </p>
