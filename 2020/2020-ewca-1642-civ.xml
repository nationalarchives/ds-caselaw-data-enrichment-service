	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">In 2008 over 150 women employed by Reading Borough Council started equal pay proceedings in the Employment Tribunal.  The claims were of the familiar kind where female employees, doing work of a kind predominantly done by women, claimed that they were being paid less than male comparators doing manual jobs predominantly done by men.  They relied on both the "rated as equivalent" and the "equal value" gateways.  In due course the claims were consolidated into a multiple known as the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The claims proceeded in the Reading Employment Tribunal.  Their management and resolution was complex, as such cases inevitably are.  The so-called GMF defence was taken first, and decisions in the claimants' favour on that issue were reached in May and October 2011.  The claims in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple related to the structure of pay and conditions applying at the time that they were brought, but it is common ground that they could and would, probably by consent, have been used as the vehicle for any claims accruing following the date of the ET1, absent any material change in the relevant circumstances. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">With effect from 1 May 2011 the council introduced a new "single status" pay structure purporting to follow the so-called Green Book principles: that is a reference to the agreement reached nationally between the relevant trade unions and representatives of local authorities many years previously.  The new structure brought together employees from the previous manual and APT&amp;C categories and assigned them to grades based on a job evaluation study which covered both.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">On 26 October 2011 83 equal pay claims were brought by council employees all of whom were already claimants in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple.  In due course the number increased to 95.  This was known as the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span> multiple.  It is common ground that the proceedings were brought in response to the introduction of the new single status terms – though, as will appear, there is some dispute as to the reason why the claimants thought it necessary to bring them or in any event to do so at that time.   </p>

In early 2018 13 of the claimants in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple withdrew their claims because they accepted that they had failed to comply with the requirements of the grievance procedure under Part 3 of the Employment Act 2002, which was in force at the time that the proceedings were started.  However, most of them were claimants in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span> multiple, and a group of them, now amounting to seven (who are the respondents before us), contended that they could still pursue in those proceedings the claims which they had originally made in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">It is the council's case that the claims pleaded in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span> multiple did not cover the period covered by the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple, and related only to the period since the introduction of single status on 1 May 2011; and that they cannot now be pressed into use as a vehicle for the claims which the claimants in question had been debarred from advancing in their original proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">I should note for completeness that the council also advanced an alternative argument to the effect that if, contrary to its case, the claims in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span> multiple did extend back before 1 May 2011 they should to that extent be struck out as an abuse of process because they duplicated the claims in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple.

All that I need say at this stage is that the specific challenges advanced (or, at any rate, adumbrated, because a major part of the claimants' complaint is that they have not been given sufficient information to assess what, if any, claim they wish to advance) are to the validity of the new job evaluation study and the new pay and grading structure which is based on it: see the second paragraph 9 up to paragraph 14.  They are to the effect that the job evaluation study and the pay and grading structure do not comply with either the Green Book principles (see paragraph 11) or the requirements for a valid job evaluation study under the 2010 Act (see in particular paragraphs 9 and 10).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Leiper submits that the only natural reading of that claim form, in the context known to the parties and the tribunal, is that it was intended to raise claims in relation only to the period following the implementation of the new pay structure.  The purpose of paragraph 1, which is central to his submissions, is plainly to explain why new claims have had to be brought notwithstanding the pendency of the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> claims, namely because of the new pay structure.  The claimants evidently recognised that the introduction of that structure meant that the claim would have to be advanced by reference to what they themselves refer to as the "altered" terms and conditions, and that it would give rise to new issues, including whether the structure continued to embody, albeit in a new form, the pay discrimination which they said obtained under the old structure, and whether the job evaluation study was reliable.  The substantive matters pleaded at paragraphs 9 to 14 are directed entirely to those issues.  That being so, the claim form could not be understood to be making any claim in relation to a period covered by a wholly different pay and grading structure giving rise to different legal issues.  That of course is reinforced by the fact that the pre-1 May 2011 period was already covered by the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> claims.  No one, Mr Leiper says, would expect it to be intended to go back and duplicate the claims already advanced in the other proceedings: there would be no point and it might indeed be abusive.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">In my view the EAT was wrong to overturn the decision of the Employment Tribunal.  Essentially I accept Mr Leiper's submissions as summarised above, which I need not repeat.  The clear effect of the grounds, read as a whole and in the context of the procedural history to which they themselves refer in paragraph 1, is that the claims are confined to the period following the introduction of the new pay structure, and the separate role of the new set of proceedings is likely to have been understood by all those concerned.  As regards the latter point, I regard it as significant that that was the understanding of the Employment Tribunal itself, which was steeped in the history of the litigation.  I should also in that connection mention one point made by Mr Leiper in his oral submissions, relating to the circumstances of a Ms Kamara.  Ms Kamara was not originally a claimant in the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple, but on 26 and 27 October 2011 she put in two claims, the first using the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span>-type claim form, and the second the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span>-type claim form.  (I say 26th <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> 27th because although the claim forms had consecutive ET numbers they are recorded as having been issued on different days.  That quirk has no significance, and in substance they can be regarded as simultaneous.)  The fact that the claimants' solicitors took the trouble to bring the two separate proceedings simultaneously clearly suggests that they understood that the claims were of different characters: if the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> claims are covered by the <span style="font-style:italic">Gordon</span> claim form, why take the trouble to issue both?   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The most powerful counter-argument, and the one on which, as I have said, Lavender J relied, is that the second sentence of paragraph 2 of the grounds evinces an intention to claim back for the full period of six years permitted by the statute.  Mr Leiper attempted to argue that that was not the effect of the words in question, but insofar as I could understand his alternative construction I was not persuaded by it.  However, that only means that we are in a situation, sometimes encountered in construing many kinds of document, where the main thrust of the document points in one direction but a particular provision, read in isolation, points in the opposite direction.  In such a case it may be legitimate to conclude that, reading the document as a whole, the words in question cannot have been intended to have effect in accordance with their apparent meaning.  In my view this is such a case.  Wording of the kind in question is entirely standard in equal pay pleadings of this kind.  It appears, for example, in the grounds pleaded in the original <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> multiple.  Its deployment in this case has all the appearance of an unthinking use of a boilerplate provision, in contrast to the very case-specific pleading of paragraphs 1 and 3.  Indeed, the character of paragraph 2 as a whole is generic.  It has to be said that the pleading as a whole has a kitchen-sink appearance and does not inspire confidence that it was put together in a careful and considered way. </p>

Thus, although it is true that the references to the Equal Pay Act as opposed to the Equality Act in paragraphs 6 and 10 are redundant if the claims do not go back beyond 1 May 2011, it seems in fact to have been clearly the drafter’s policy to refer to both statutes on a belt-and-braces basis even if it was inappropriate to do so.  For example, the first sentence of paragraph 1 refers to the claimants having submitted claims "under the Equal Pay Act 1970 and/or the Equality Act 2010", whereas in fact the <span style="font-style:italic">James</span> claims were brought under the 1970 Act alone.   </p>
