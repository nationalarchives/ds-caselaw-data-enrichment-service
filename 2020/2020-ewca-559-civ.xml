	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The central question on this appeal is whether the First Appellant, Alfred McConnell (whose name was at one time anonymised to TT), a transgender man and holder of a gender recognition certificate, is entitled to be registered as the “father”, or otherwise “parent” or “gestational parent”, on the birth certificate of his son, YY, to whom he gave birth.  YY is the Second Appellant.  An anonymity order remains in place in relation to YY.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Respondent, who is responsible for maintaining the register of births and deaths, decided that Mr McConnell had to be registered on the birth certificate as YY’s “mother”.  Mr McConnell applied for judicial review of that decision, which was refused on 25 September 2019 by the President of the Family Division, sitting in the Administrative Court.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition, an application was made on behalf of YY for a declaration of parentage under section 55A of the Family Law Act 1986.  On that application the President, sitting in the Family Court, made a declaration that Mr McConnell is YY’s mother and accordingly has parental responsibility for him for that reason by virtue of section 2(2) of the Children Act 1989. This declaration followed inevitably from the reasoning of the President in refusing the claim for judicial review. </p>

He began medical transition with testosterone therapy in 2013.  He then, in 2014, underwent a double mastectomy.  His passport and NHS records were amended to show his gender as male.  </p>

The Appellants submit that it can only have retrospective effect, i.e. that the issuance of a gender recognition certificate does not affect the status of a person as being either the mother or the father of a child if that child was born before the certificate was issued.  They submit that in a case like the present, where YY was born after the certificate was issued to Mr McConnell, section 12 can have no effect.  The Respondents submit that it has both retrospective and prospective effect.  </p>

The following propositions are apparent from that passage.  First, the court’s task is an objective one, to assess the compatibility of the legislation with Convention rights, by reference to the well-known criteria, such as whether it has a legitimate aim and whether it conforms with the principle of proportionality.  Secondly, that task has to be performed at the time when the issue comes before the court, just as it would be performed by the Strasbourg Court at the time when a case comes before it.  Thirdly, the court is not concerned with the adequacy of the reasons which were put forward by ministers or others for the legislation as it proceeded through Parliament; indeed that would infringe the principle in Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, that a court may not question proceedings in Parliament.  It follows that the court is not concerned with the adequacy or otherwise of what may have been said by civil servants advising ministers at the time of the legislation being considered, still less subsequently.  What matters is whether the legislation enacted by Parliament is or is not compatible with the Convention rights. </p>

In enacting the GRA Parliament took a different course. It did not impose a requirement for surgery or for there to be a transition physiologically to the new gender.  Parliament went further than the judgment of the Strasbourg Court strictly required.  We were informed at the hearing that in many states it was necessary for a trans person to be sterilised before being recognised in their acquired gender and that the most obvious physical attributes of the former gender had to be extinguished.  In that context we note the decision of the Strasbourg Court in <span style="font-style:italic">AP, Garçon and Nicot v France </span>(App Nos. 79885/12, 52471/13 and 52596/13), in which the Court held that a requirement that a trans person be sterilised in order to receive legal recognition breached Article 8 of the Convention.  In any event, that is not the position which Parliament took in enacting the GRA.  It is that fact which has led to the physical possibility that a trans man such as Mr McConnell can conceive, become pregnant and give birth to a child.  He is by no means unique.  The material before the Court shows that there are other trans men who have been able to bear children in both this country and abroad. </p>

For present purposes the relevant exception is contained in section 12.  It follows that, although for most purposes a person must be regarded in law as being of their acquired gender after the certificate has been issued, where an exception applies, they are still to be treated as having their gender at birth.  For that reason, in our view, it is not possible simply to say that Parliament has “de-coupled” the concept of “mother” from gender, as Mr Jaffey suggested at the hearing before us.  This appears to be how the Authority has interpreted the effect of the judgment of the High Court in the present case by amending its code of practice in December 2019 to reflect this point: see para. 6.30. </p>

Nevertheless, we are not concerned with a trivial interference.  It is true that the circumstances in which the long-form birth certificate recording someone in Mr McConnell’s position as “mother” are limited.  For most purposes the short-form certificate will suffice.  That does not include reference to the status of Mr McConnell as being YY’s mother.  It is for the more basic reason of this being an example of the state requiring a trans person to declare in a formal document that their gender is not their current gender but the gender assigned at birth.  That represents a significant interference with a person’s sense of their own identity, which is an integral aspect of the right to respect for private life in Article 8.  It is also an interference with the right to respect for family life of both Mr McConnell and his son because the state describes their relationship on the long form of YY’s birth certificate as being that of </p>

It consists of the protection of the rights of others, including any children who are born to a transgender person, and the maintenance of a clear and coherent scheme of registration of births.  It is important in this context to bear in mind that this is a question to be addressed at a general level.  It does not turn on the facts of this or any other particular case.  The question is not whether it would be in the best interests of YY to have the person who gave birth to him described as his mother on the longform birth certificate.  The question is whether the rights of children generally include the right to know who gave birth to them and what that person’s status was. </p>

Importantly, in our view, that is the word that is used in section 2(2)(a) of that Act.  It provides that a mother has automatic parental responsibility for a child from the moment of birth.  No-one else has that automatic parental responsibility, including the father.  There is no need for any registration document for that purpose.  The fact of giving birth to a child has that effect as a matter of operation of law.  It can readily be understood why this could be important in practice.  From the moment of birth someone must have parental responsibility for a newly born child, for example, to authorise medical treatment and more generally to become responsible for its care.    </p>

In those contexts, the policy choice of Parliament is that the person who gives birth to a child is always described as the mother of that child, even if (for example) it was not her egg which was fertilised.

It held that the fact that the trans man was recognised as belonging to the male gender at the time of the child’s birth did not affect the assignment of “status” as mother.  §11 TSG was properly considered an exception to §10 TSG; recognition in the “new” gender with all its antecedent “gender-dependent” rights and duties, was subject to the express exception for parent-child relationships.  The Court laid emphasis on the right of a child of a trans person to know its origins (<span style="font-style:italic">Abstammungsrecht</span>).  </p>

It emphasised the wide margin of appreciation accorded to Contracting States relating to the legal recognition of trans identities.  This wide margin of appreciation was grounded in the need to balance private/public interests and competing Convention rights.   Germany had not overstepped this margin by requiring a trans person’s status as “father” or “mother” to a child born to them to be determined with respect to their reproductive role, as opposed to in accordance with the “new” legal gender of the transgender person.  There was an absence of European consensus.  The German legal provisions adequately took into account: (i) the public interest in the coherence of the national legal order; and (ii) the child’s right to personal knowledge of his/her parentage, which is also protected by Article 8(1) of the Convention.  </p>

The evidence suggests that some states have taken the step of reforming their law so as to achieve what in effect the Appellants seek to achieve.

The concept of a margin of appreciation is not directly relevant when courts in this country apply the HRA.  This is because it is a concept of international law and not domestic law, governing the relationship between an international court and Contracting States.  Nevertheless, it is well established that there is an analogous concept which does apply in domestic law under the HRA, which has been variously described as a “discretionary area of judgement”, a “margin of discretion” or in other ways, for example to refer to the appropriate weight which is to be given to the judgement of the executive or legislature depending upon the context: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex p. Kebilene</span> [2000] 2 AC 326, at 381 (Lord Hope of Craighead); and <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2004] UKHL 56; [2005] 2 AC 68, at para. 39 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This brings us to an important aspect of this case.  The margin of judgement which is to be afforded to Parliament in the present context rests upon two foundations.  First, there is the relative institutional competence of the courts as compared to Parliament.  The court necessarily operates on the basis of relatively limited evidence, which is adduced by the parties in the context of particular litigation.  Its focus is narrow and the argument is necessarily sectional. In contrast, Parliament has the means and opportunities to obtain wider information, from much wider sources.  It has access to expert bodies, such as the Law Commission, which can advise it on reform of the law.  It is able to act upon draft legislation, which is usually produced by the Government and often follows a public consultation exercise, in which many differing views can be advanced by members of the public.  Both Government and Members of Parliament can be lobbied by anyone with an interest in the subject in hand.  The political process allows legislators to acquire information to inform policy decisions from the widest possible range of opinions. We have no idea, for example, whether all trans men object to the use of the word “mother” to refer to them when they have given birth to a child.  It may be that some at least wish to have the automatic responsibility for the child to whom they have given birth which section 2 of the Children Act 1989 currently gives them.  Moreover, we do not have evidence before this Court as to how other members of society would feel if they were no longer to be referred to on their child’s birth certificate as a mother or a father but simply as “parent 1” and “parent 2”.  Those were among the possible ways forward which were suggested on behalf of the Appellants.  In our view this illustrates how inapt the subject-matter is for determination by the courts as compared with Parliament.  If there is to be reform of the complicated, inter-linked legislation in this context, it must be for Parliament and not for this Court. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The second foundation is that Parliament enjoys a democratic legitimacy in our society which the courts do not.  In particular, that legitimises its interventions in areas of difficult or controversial social policy. That is not to say that the courts should abdicate the function required by Parliament itself to protect the rights which are conferred by the HRA.  The courts have their proper role to play in the careful scheme of the HRA, as Lord Bingham emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>, at para. 42.  In appropriate cases that can include making a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 in respect of primary legislation where an incompatibility between domestic legislation and Convention rights has been established and the interpretative tool provided by section 3 does not provide a solution.  Democratic legitimacy provides another basis for concluding that the courts should be slow to occupy the margin of judgement more appropriately within the preserve of Parliament.   </p>

In our judgement, that is precisely what Parliament has done in enacting a carefully crafted set of provisions which balance the rights of transgender people and others, including their children.  The view that Parliament has taken is that every child should have a mother and should be able to discover who their mother was, because that is in the child’s best interests.  Others may take a different view and in time may be able to persuade Parliament to take a different view.  What cannot be doubted is that Parliament has taken into account the best interests of children as a primary consideration. </p>
