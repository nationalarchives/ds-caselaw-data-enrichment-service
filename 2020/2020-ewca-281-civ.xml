	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns the court’s power to make a child assessment order under s.43 of the Children Act 1989.  It arises in relation to  a family with five children.  The children, whose ages range between 18 and 9, are making excellent progress and have impressed everyone who has met them.  Why then are they the subject of proceedings?  The answer lies in their father’s conviction under the Terrorism Act 2000, for which he received a substantial prison sentence.  His offences consisted of addressing meetings to encourage support for or further the activities of Islamic State.  He had for many years been associated with extremist beliefs and has a previous conviction for violent disorder arising from a sectarian assault, for which he served a term of imprisonment in 2014.  In January 2015 he was made the subject of an ASBO arising from earlier violent demonstrations.  In December 2015 he was arrested for the terrorist offences. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Following the father’s arrest, there was concern about the impact of his beliefs and activities on the family.  It was found that one or more of the children had been taken to meetings at which the father had spoken, and an image of a beheading was found on one of the children’s phones.  More recently, evidence emerged showing one or more of the children holding placards at a demonstration in support of the Caliphate.  In early 2017 the local authority in whose area the family lives therefore carried out an investigation under s.47.  At that stage the mother was assessed as recognising the risks and acting protectively.  There was no evidence of her being implicated in the father’s views and activities.  The local authority’s plan was for further assessment when the father was due to be released from prison.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The father was released on licence in late 2018, and was placed in a hostel.  A further s.47 assessment was undertaken by the local authority.  By contrast with the earlier assessment, this raised considerable concerns about the mother’s protectiveness.  She said that the father had strong views but that they were not criminal.  She referred to the undercover officer whose evidence had led to the father’s conviction as a “snitch”.  The assessment, completed on 13 March 2019, concluded that: a Child in Need plan was required (as the father wanted to go home); the Probation risk assessment should be obtained to identify the father’s current view of his offending; the father should be interviewed; an Intervention Provider should be instructed to talk to the children; fuller work should be carried out to provide the children with clear information about their father’s offending; the father’s interaction with the children should be observed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The mother opposed these interventions, describing them as a collective punishment driven by religion and not genuine concern.  The local authority convened a Child Protection Case Conference on 20 May and the children became subject to Child Protection Plans.  A referral was made to Prevent so that the case could be discussed within the Channel Panel, a multi-agency panel designed to safeguard individuals at risk.  In June, the parents consented to direct work being done with the children but later that month they withdrew that consent.  The mother declined to meet a representative from Prevent or engage with a parenting assessment.  As a result, the Probation Service advised that the father’s licence conditions had been changed so that the mother was no longer approved to supervise contact.   At the Channel Panel meeting on 5 July it was decided that the children should be assessed by an Intervention Provider to establish whether they required mentoring with the aim of increasing theological understanding and challenging extremist ideas that may be used to legitimise terrorism.  The parents declined to consent to this assessment.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These events added to the local authority’s concerns.  On 22 July, it initiated the process leading to public law proceedings (the PLO process) by sending formal letters to the parents, as a result of which they qualified for legal representation.  Then, on 20 August, the father’s licence was revoked due to a breach of his licence conditions.  He remains in custody and his release date is not known.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A PLO meeting took place on 5 September.  The mother attended on her own. She refused to consent to unannounced visits, a parenting assessment, direct work with the children, or to work being carried out by an Intervention Provider. Further details of the parenting assessment and the direct work proposed were provided to the mother by letter but on 23 September she responded by saying that she did not consent to any work being carried out.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 7 October, the local authority decided to apply for a child assessment order, with a view to an assessment being carried out by an Intervention Provider.  It issued its application on 4 November.  Directions were given by Newton J on 13 November and the final hearing took place on 4 December. The application was opposed by both parents and by the four older children, who were separately represented (the eldest has since turned 18 and is no longer the subject of proceedings).  It was however supported by the Children’s Guardian.  He considered that it is not known whether the children have been exposed to the risk of radicalisation by their father’s actions and beliefs, or whether their mother is fully protective.  The family’s unwillingness to work with the local authority has prevented it from assessing either the level of risk or what support can be offered.  </p>

However, on the appeal neither the mother (following a change of leading counsel) nor the children sought to uphold the judge’s decision in this respect and it was left to Mr Twomey QC and Mr Barnes to pursue it.  The argument runs like this.  The effect of ss. (1)(a) and (b) is that the local authority must have reasonable cause to suspect harm or likelihood of harm and the assessment must be required to enable it to determine whether harm or likelihood of harm exists.  The local authority must, they say, demonstrate that it has “a suspicion (and no more)”.  In this case, the local authority could only have decided to place the children on child protection plans and to activate the PLO process if it had already judged there to be the existence or likelihood of harm: Working Together to Safeguard Children 2018, page 45.  Its state of mind was therefore one of belief, not suspicion, and accordingly the test under (a) is not satisfied.  Nor, for the same reason, can the local authority meet the test under (b) because the assessment is not <span style="font-style:italic">required</span> to enable it to determine whether or not the children are suffering or likely to suffer significant harm: it already believes that they are.

It would not be open to the case conference to decide that an application under s.43 was an appropriate course to safeguard the children.  Put another way, if the local authority wanted to seek an order under s.43, it was obliged to go to court before calling a child protection conference.  Once it had reached the stage of ‘belief’ the only options open to it were (a) doing nothing, (b) continuing to seek the parents’ consent, or (c) issuing care proceedings.  These outcomes are, he said, mandated by the plain words of ss.(1), but he was unable to suggest any good sense to this interpretation, either in terms of child welfare or good social work practice.  In particular, he was unable to rebut the local authority’s argument that it would be fundamentally contrary to good social work practice and to statutory guidance for a local authority to apply for a court order before seeking to work with the parents by less interventionist means. </p>

The assessment is designed to provide a range of information, identifying not only whether harm may exist, but also describing its nature and extent.  Nothing less will allow the local authority to understand the child’s situation and determine how best to proceed.  The narrow interpretation of the provision accepted by the judge overlooks the essential qualitative character of the assessment process.   It also fails to connect with his own description of the underlying question as being “under what circumstances might the parents’ religious views and activities result in harm to the children’s physical and emotional health and wellbeing?”  That was the question to which the assessment would be directed.  </p>

Even on a superficial appraisal of what was known or could have easily been ascertained in 2015, or later, it might be considered by a reasonable citizen that it was completely reasonable to be at least be suspicious that the children, or some of them, had been caused or were likely to suffer significant harm, but 4 uneventful years have now elapsed.” </p>

The judge mentioned all the developments in the case and was entitled to note the actual evidence of the children’s positive presentation.  In a submission that is scarcely consistent with his submissions in relation to jurisdiction, Mr Twomey argued on behalf of the father that the local authority did not have grounds for reasonable suspicion but rather unsubstantiated speculation.  On behalf of the mother it is said that she is entirely within her rights to resist further intervention by the local authority.  She has cooperated with investigations that support only one conclusion, namely that she is providing good care and the children are developing appropriately and achieving well in education. The mother's position is informed by the views of the children and in the context of the history it is reasonable and justified.  By relying on the absence of evidence, the local authority is reversing the burden of proof.  The judge was right to dismiss the application   </p>

The description of the assessment proposal as heavy-handed, disproportionate and overbearing cannot be sustained.  High-performing, law-abiding children are not immune from the insidious lure of extremism.  The proposed assessment was by no stretch of the imagination disproportionate to the risk in this case.  The submission that the children would be left in a vulnerable position without legal representation or that they might be placed in a situation that was unfair is a misreading of the nature of the child protection and litigation processes.  Social workers and intervention providers are not threats from whom the children must be protected, but public servants who are seeking to protect these children by means of the least intrusive intervention.  The children’s committed lawyers (both those they instruct directly and those representing the Children’s Guardian) will surely not become unavailable to them at the moment the order is made, in the face of an imminent brief assessment.   </p>

As can be seen from the statutory guidance, it is not strictly correct to characterise a child assessment order as an emergency intervention.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Drawing matters together, a child assessment order allows for a brief, focussed assessment of the state of a child’s health or development, or the way in which he or she has been treated, where that is required to enable the local authority to determine whether or not the child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm and to establish whether there is a need and justification for any further action.  The purpose of the assessment is to provide a range of information, identifying not only whether harm may exist, but also describing its nature and extent.  It is part of the process of gathering information so that any child protection measures can be appropriately calibrated.  It is the least interventionist of the court’s child protection powers and is designed to enable information that cannot be obtained by other means to be gathered without the need to remove the child from home.  It is not an emergency power and it may be particularly apt where the suspected harm to the child may be longer-term and cumulative rather than sudden and severe.   The order is compulsory in relation to parents but not for a competent child who refuses to participate.  The views of an older child are an important consideration when a decision is taken about making an order, but it cannot be said that opposition makes an order unlikely: it depends on the facts of the case and the nature of the risk and the assessment. </p>
