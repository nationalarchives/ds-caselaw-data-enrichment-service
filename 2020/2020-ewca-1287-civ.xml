	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Y’s parents are profoundly deaf. Their participation in court proceedings requires the assistance of sign language interpreters and, in the case of the mother, a deafregistered intermediary. Inevitably their participation in these proceedings has been made more difficult because the hearings before the judge and before this Court have been conducted remotely in accordance with the Covid 19 protocols. Unsurprisingly, there were some problems over the arrangements for the hearing of the appeal, which was the first remote hearing before this Court involving litigants with hearing difficulties. In a skeleton argument filed on behalf of the mother, we were invited to give updated guidance for managing cases involving litigants suffering from such disabilities in the new legal landscape of remote and hybrid hearings in family proceedings, building on the guidance given by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re C (A Child)</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 128 which was based in part on my observations about assistance for disabled litigants in children’s proceedings at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Wiltshire Council v N</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">and others</span> [2013] EWHC 3502 (Fam). For my part, I do not think it would be appropriate to give such guidance in this judgment. The problems referred to above led to a delay in the start of the hearing, and legal argument was confined to the issues arising on the appeal. We heard no further submissions on the wider issues of practice. In those circumstances, I would prefer to deal with those wider issues by referring the matter to the President of the Family Division and to MacDonald J, who with the President’s approval has published guidance on the conduct of remote and hybrid hearings in the family jurisdiction, to consider whether the guidance needs amendment to address the difficulties faced by disabled litigants in general and those with hearing loss in particular.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Meanwhile, I would reiterate the core aspects of the guidance given by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re C</span> – that it is the duty of lawyers acting for a parent who has a hearing disability to identify that as a feature of the case at the earliest opportunity, that those lawyers and the local authority should make the issue known to the court at the time that the proceedings are issued, and that the court must grapple with the issue, including the support required and the funding of that support, at the first case management hearing with the aim of giving clear and detailed directions. A similar course should be adopted in this Court so that, if permission to appeal is granted, the single Lord or Lady Justice can give all necessary directions, either on paper or, if appropriate, at a preliminary hearing. In the case of remote or hybrid hearings, where the party, interpreter and/or intermediary are not together in the same room, it will be necessary to consider how they can communicate with each other separately from and alongside the platform through which the hearing is being conducted. That may or may not be a matter for a court direction but it will certainly be something to be considered and arranged by the parties’ solicitors.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In March 2018, the local authority started care proceedings in respect of Y and his older half-siblings after Y, then a few weeks old, was taken to hospital and found to have sustained ten fractures of various ages to his ribs, both femurs and both tibias, and a number of bruises. In the course of the proceedings, the parents accepted that the injuries had been inflicted by Y’s father. At a fact-finding hearing in April 2019, HH Judge Wicks made a series of findings some of which were agreed by the parents and others of which were not. They accepted that the fractures had been inflicted by the father, that he had been violent to the mother, and that the mother had failed to take appropriate action in response to his treatment of her, placing herself and the children at risk from his volatile and violent behaviour. In addition, the judge found on a balance of probabilities that the bruises had been inflicted by the father, that the mother knew that the father posed a risk of harm to Y but had failed to protect him, and that the father (though not the mother) had failed to seek timely assistance for Y. In reaching those findings, the judge concluded that the parents were willing to lie when it suited them and had lied to the court about a number of matters, in particular about their relationship. In addition, the judge made some further findings about members of the mother’s extended family which it is unnecessary to consider in this judgment. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final hearing of the care proceedings took place a few months later in July 2019. Y’s half siblings were made subject to a full care order on the basis of a care plan providing that they be placed with a maternal great aunt and uncle. With regard to Y, the parents accepted that he could not be returned to their care and no other family members were put forward as possible carers. The judge therefore identified only two realistic options for his future – long-term- fostering, which was supported by the parents, and adoption, which was supported by the local authority and guardian. Having carried out an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each option, he accepted the local authority’s case, approved the care plan, and made care and placement orders. </p>

The pros of refusing leave were that an adoption order would be made swiftly, allowing the child to become part of his new family where he has settled well and is thriving.

If the court grants leave, it will in due course have to analyse, with the appropriate rigour, the various options for Y, of which adoption will be one. The court will need to weigh in the balance all the relevant factors, including the parents’ abilities to care safely for Y, either immediately or in the future, Y’s relationships with his wider family, in particular his siblings, his need for a stable and secure placement, and so on (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list). I am of course aware that I have already carried out that exercise once before, in considering the placement application, but nearly a year has passed since then, circumstances have changed, and Y has continued to have a relationship with his siblings. When I considered the placement application, I was of the view that the need to preserve a sibling relationship was outweighed by the greater degree of permanency, of ‘belonging’, that an adoptive placement offered. That may not be the case now, nearly a year on. Of course, I keep an absolutely open mind, but the advantage of granting leave is that these issues can be revisited, in the light of the changed circumstances, which must be to the benefit of Y when I consider his welfare throughout his life. </p>

Although they are in a relationship, the mother is clear that she opposes any review of the findings (and is therefore presumed to accept those findings), whilst the father’s very clear position is that he does not accept those findings, and does not accept that he was responsible for Y’s injuries. The parents lied about their relationship in the care proceedings, and there must be a very real risk that they are putting their need to be in a relationship with each other above the needs of any child in their care.” </p>

The parents ruled themselves out in the care proceedings, as they did not put themselves forward to care for any of the children. Further, the relationship between Y and his half siblings has continued and it is at least arguable that this needs to be re-evaluated as part of any welfare analysis of the competing options for Y.

It is unnecessary to set out all of the questions posed by the local authority or the judge’s responses. The important points to emerge from this process are as follows. First, the local authority enquired how the court reconciled its previous finding that the parents had lied about their continuing relationship, and evidence that they had continued to lie about it, with its conclusion that the relationship had stabilised. The judge responded that, as he observed in his judgment, there were real concerns about the parents’ relationship which would require careful analysis, that he had kept in mind his previous findings about their lack of candour and noted the evidence that this had allegedly continued. He added, however, that what he was assessing was not the prospects of the parents having Y return to their care but “their prospects of successfully persuading the court that the draconian option of adoption is no longer justified.” Secondly, the local authority enquired how the court reconciled the father’s failure to accept the court’s previous findings with his assertion that he had made changes. The judge responded by observing that the case law made clear that the legal test was not a high bar to cross and that the parents’ contradictory positions as to the findings in the care proceedings would require careful analysis. Thirdly, the local authority informed the court that Y has had direct contact with his siblings on only three occasions since the making of the placement order and enquired whether that information changed the court’s view. The judge retorted that this information did not change his conclusion and expressed concern that sibling contact had been so limited, adding  </p>

The judge had wrongly stated when clarifying his reasons that the level of contact which had occurred was in some way contrary to the care plan and that his welfare analysis in the care proceedings had been based “in no small part” on a commitment by the local authority to find adopters willing to promote sibling contact. Furthermore, in considering the feasibility of ongoing contact, the judge should have taken into account the statements by the father that he will seek out the child wherever he is placed.  </p>

In respect of the three matters referred to in paragraph 29 of his judgment, his analysis was clearly based on the evidence and submissions advanced by the parents, in particular on behalf of the mother. For example, his conclusion that the evidence of stabilisation in the parents’ relationship amounted to a change of circumstances was based on a number of factors identified on behalf of the mother - a move to a better neighbourhood, the fact that there were no reports of domestic violence, the parents’ engagement with mental health services and their adherence to a regime of education. In reaching his conclusion, the judge was drawing on his long experience of the case.

The argument that the assertion that the relationship had stabilised was undermined by the parents’ previous dishonesty as to their relationship was said to be lacking in logic. The criticism of the parents during the care proceedings was that they were dishonestly denying they were still in a relationship. Their case now is that they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> still in a relationship and that it has stabilised. The argument that the father’s assertion as to his anger management counselling was unsupported by independent evidence was insufficient to displace the judge’s finding. At the permission stage, it was unsurprising that the assertion was unsupported by such evidence, particularly when the father was unrepresented. Similarly, the fact that there was no independent evidence to support the parents’ assertion that there had been no domestic abuse since the end of the care proceedings did not preclude the judge accepting the assertion in the qualified way that he did, noting that at this stage he only had the parents’ word that this change had occurred. The local authority did not provide any evidence of continuing domestic conflict between the parents. The judge rightly recognised that at the final hearing of the adoption application there would need to be a careful investigation of whether the changes asserted by the parents have indeed occurred. A full investigation was neither necessary nor appropriate at the permission stage.  </p>

In this case, the judge gave cogent reasons for reaching the conclusion that the parents’ case was solid. It was clearly an important part of his reasoning that Y was having contact with his half-siblings. On behalf of the mother Mr Macdonald acknowledged that the judge’s observations in his response to the local authority’s request for clarification included an erroneous recollection of what had been said about post-adoption contact during the final hearing in the care proceedings. Nevertheless, the fact that such contact has actually been taking place and the possibility that it could not be guaranteed to continue if Y were to be adopted were clearly important factors for the judge’s consideration when determining whether the parents had solid grounds for seeking leave to oppose the application. </p>

I accept that delay in reaching a decision about a child’s legal status may have an adverse effect on the child, but not to the same extent as a delay in deciding whether or not a child should move home.
