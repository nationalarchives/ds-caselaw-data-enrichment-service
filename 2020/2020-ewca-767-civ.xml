The head teacher spoke to B who made a number of allegations against her parents. The conversation lasted for about 90 minutes. The head teacher took notes but did not make a verbatim record of the allegations. At the fact-finding hearing, asked why she had not made a fuller note, she said that B’s account had been “an outpouring – I just couldn’t keep up – it was the salient points”. At one point, B asked if she could write down what she wanted to say. She wrote: </p>

When asked where her father had touched her, she indicated her waist, lower waist, side of the hips, buttocks, upper thighs and the front of her body. She said that her mother had seen her father get into bed with her but did not stop him. She added that her aunt from Scotland had said she could not help as it was a family matter and she must tell her dad to stop. B said that on one occasion she had tried to run away from home. Asked about her mother’s behaviour, B described how she would hit her if her test marks fell below a certain level. </p>

Later that day, a police officer and social worker visited the school and spoke to B for about forty minutes in the head teacher’s presence. It was their evidence that B’s account was “all flowing out” without prompting. She told them about the academic pressure she felt under at home. She described how her father would get into bed with her and touch her body. Asked where he touched her, she mentioned her lower back and pointed to her abdomen. She said that sometimes her mother would be in the bed as well but did not seem bothered about what was happening. She said that she had tried to tell her Scottish aunt who had said she couldn’t help and that it was for her parents to sort out.  </p>

The mother suggested that B was seeking attention by exaggerating, and letting her imagination run away with itself. She also suggested that the allegations could be explained by the academic pressure on B, or hormonal changes, or conversations with friends, or exposure to such matters at school. In his police interview, the father also said that B had been exposed to conversations about sex at school. He spoke about pressures at school and about B’s jealousy of Y. Asked by the police officer whether he understood the offence of intentional sexual touching of a girl aged under nine, the father had said that he thought it was “a subjective thing”. In his evidence, he suggested that she may have become confused as a result of sex education lessons. He said that he displays physical affection towards his children – describing himself as a “cuddly, touchyfeely sort of person” – and added that he and girls enjoyed tickling each other. He accepted that he had touched her by squeezing and wiggling his hand as described by B but not her private parts and with no sexual element. He wondered whether B had become uncomfortable with the physical contact between them and whether as she approached puberty she was finding it hard to differentiate between what was right and wrong in sexual matters. He said that it was “a matter of interpretation” and “not black and white”. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">First, it was argued that the judge failed to address the manifest inconsistencies in the evidence of the child and, by making findings in respect of the allegations against the father and not against the mother, his approach lacked overall consistency and coherence. Mr Rowley drew attention to a number of inconsistencies in B’s various accounts to the head teacher, to the police officer and social worker during their conversation at the school, and in the ABE interview. One important difference concerned the parts of the body which the father was said to have touched. Mr Rowley pointed out that it was only during the ABE interview that the child mentioned that he had touched her genital area. Another example was whether or not the mother was aware of the father’s behaviour. B told the head teacher that the mother knew about it but didn’t seem that bothered. In the ABE interview, she said that she thought that the mother knew but she may not have done. There were also differences in B’s various accounts about conversations she had with the schoolfriend and her parents before speaking to the head teacher. There were inconsistencies in B’s descriptions of what her father was wearing when he got into bed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr Rowley submitted that there were inconsistencies and illogicalities in the judge’s assessment of the allegations against the father on the one hand and the mother on the other. In considering the allegations against the father, the judge relied on the child’s emotional presentation in her conversations with the head teacher, social worker and police officer as supporting the veracity of the allegations. Mr Rowley observed that the child was presenting in the same way when making allegations about her mother, which the judge subsequently accepted had been exaggerated. He also submitted that, in finding that the mother had not been aware of the father’s behaviour, he had overlooked the child’s statement to the social worker and police officer that she “didn’t seem to be bothered”.

	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">that allegations against the mother were exaggerated and, in some respects, untrue or inaccurate, it was illogical not to reach the same conclusion about the allegations against the father.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Secondly, it was argued that the judge wrongly concluded that the allegations amounted to sexual abuse. It was submitted that there was nothing in the child’s description of the father’s behaviour which definitively amounted to sexual activity. In reaching his conclusion that the father had behaved in a sexually inappropriate way, the judge failed to give any or any adequate consideration to the fact that the father is a man of good character with no other signs of aberrant sexual interests; that the behaviour was said to have occurred when Y, and sometimes the mother, were also in the bed; and that there was no indication that the father was sexually aroused, nor any evidence of grooming. The only alleged incident which could be interpreted as amounting to sexual abuse was a solitary occasion some years earlier when the father was said to have “tapped” B’s genital area. Overall, the father’s conduct as alleged by the child was at least as consistent with an innocent explanation. Mr Rowley submitted that there was little consideration of these matters in the judgment. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">Instead, the judge focused on aspects of the father’s evidence about which he had concerns – his description of his behaviour which the judge described as “very odd indeed” and his observation that the interpretation of whether behaviour was sexual was “subjective” and “not black and white”, with which the judge disagreed. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Thirdly, it was submitted that the judge failed to consider other aspects of the evidence in addition to the matters cited in the previous paragraph. It was argued that he failed to analyse the allegations in light of the totality of the evidence, placed inappropriate weight on the allegations made by the child in her ABE interview and in doing so placed insufficient weight on the repeated attempts by the child to offer an alternative explanation or to retract. Mr Rowley submitted that there were significant gaps in the evidence to which the judge failed to attach any or any sufficient weight. In particular, there was no direct evidence from B’s schoolfriend or the schoolfriend’s parents to whom B first made the allegations against her father. The absence of this evidence ought to have led the judge to adopt a more cautious approach to B’s subsequent accounts because he did not know anything about the earlier conversations which may have moulded the narrative. Furthermore, the treatment of the absence of this evidence at paragraph 154 of the judgment was flawed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It was further argued that the judge’s analysis of the child’s retractions was inadequate, particularly in the context of the judge’s finding that he accepted some of the allegations but not others. There had been several conversations in which the child had clearly retracted elements of her allegations, but there was no verbatim note of any of those conversations, nor was a further interview arranged. In the circumstances, it was wrong to attach significant weight to the child’s allegations in the ABE interview.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, it was submitted that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the breaches of the ABE guidelines and the impact that they had on the content and reliability of the evidence. It was argued that there was no proper attempt to establish that the child understood the difference between truth and lies – an omission that was important given the fluctuations in the child’s various accounts.

As Ms Healing reminded us on behalf of the local authority, the judge did make findings against the mother in accordance with some of the allegations made by the child. It did not necessarily follow from the fact that B exaggerated her allegations against her mother that her allegations against father were also exaggerated or untrue.

It was therefore necessary for the court to consider the risk that B’s accounts of abuse had been contaminated or influenced by those conversations. It is clear from the judgment that the judge took this issue into consideration, although I accept that his explanation (at paragraphs 128 and 154 of his judgment) for disregarding it is not as complete as it could have been. He was, however, plainly aware of the issue when considering the reliability of B’s allegations against her father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Conducting interviews of children is a challenging task, even for well-trained and experienced officers. The provisions of the ABE guidance about the conduct of interviews of children are detailed. There are many examples in the reported case law of interviews which have been conducted so poorly that no forensic weight can be attached to anything the child has said. Even in cases where the interview has been conducted largely in accordance with the guidance, it is almost invariably the case that the interviewer occasionally asks a question that, ideally, would have been phrased differently. In this case, for example, the interviewer introduced the question of B’s allegations by asking her to say what she had said to the head teacher. Good practice requires that the child be asked to say what happened, rather than to repeat what she has said in an earlier conversation. In some cases, errors of this sort can undermine the forensic value of the interview. Not in this case, however. Reading the interview as a whole, I do not think there is any concern that the child may have been misled by the question into repeating a false account given on an earlier occasion. This was an isolated error by the interviewer. It is true that the subject of “truth and lies” is not covered in the conventional way recommended in the guidance but, as demonstrated in the passage cited above, the officer did emphasise to B that she needed to tell the truth, and B’s replies demonstrated that she understood why this was important. Overall, Mr Rowley was unable to identify mistakes in the conduct of the interview on a scale sufficient to call into question the reliability of the process.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">It is clear from the judgment that the judge considered both the video recording of the ABE interview (which he viewed a number of times) and the written transcript very carefully. He approached his analysis of the material in this way: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.99in">“I think what is appropriate is for the court to look at an ABE interview as a whole (it is part and parcel, of course, of a wider canvas) and consider the matter holistically.  The court has to be realistic when looking at a lengthy account - and this is in relation to the submission that B’s ABE interview lacked consistency in key details - the court has to be realistic.  In a lengthy account repeated thereafter it is too easy to find an inconsistency here or there; it would be surprising if there were a verbatim repetition of events. The question, in my judgment, is - are any inconsistencies significant and material?  Do they impact on the whole in a way as to render credibility in doubt?”   </p>

Having carried out the analysis in that way, and considered the contents of the interview in the context of all the other evidence, the judge was entitled to conclude that the statements made by the child during the interview about her father’s behaviour were accurate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, there is the issue about the sexual element in the father’s behaviour. I do not accept the argument that the judge’s failure to refer to various matters identified by Mr Rowley undermined his analysis of this aspect of the case. A number of those matters featured in Ms Holloran’s closing written submissions. The judge considered but rejected her submission that there was nothing to suggest that the touching described by the child was sexual. He concluded that the language used by the child suggested that it was. Having considered the transcript of the interview – in particular, the passages cited above – in the context of the totality of the evidence, I think he was entitled to reach that conclusion.  </p>
