	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The dispute being arbitrated in New York arises in the context of two settlement agreements between the appellants and the first and second respondents respectively in relation to the exploration and development of an oil field off the coast of Central Asia. Under those agreements the appellants were entitled to a percentage of the net sale proceeds if the first and second respondents sold their respective interests in the field, which they did in 2002. A central issue in the arbitration is the nature of certain payments made by the first and second respondents to the Central Asian government described as “signature bonuses” and whether those amounts are deductible as costs in calculating the sums due to the appellants.  </p>

Furthermore, the reference in section 44(2)(a) to “the taking of evidence of witnesses” might suggest that it was principally concerned with securing evidence from witnesses who are not in the control of the arbitrating parties.

There the arbitration tribunal sitting in New York issued a letter of request for the taking of evidence in this jurisdiction of two Lloyd’s brokers. Moore-Bick J set aside an order obtained ex parte for the taking of their evidence under section 1 of the Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act 1975 on the basis that the arbitration tribunal was not a “tribunal” within the meaning of the Act.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The approach of Foxton J was particularly influenced by two decisions at first instance. The first was the decision of Males J, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">Cruz City Mauritius Holdings v Unitech Limited</span> [2014] EWHC 3704 (Comm); [2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 191 which concerned an attempt to serve out of the jurisdiction an application for a freezing injunction against non-parties to the arbitration. As Foxton J says at [15], the immediate question in that case was whether service out against a non-party to the arbitration was possible under CPR 62.5(1)(c) although in considering that question Males J had to consider whether CPR 62.5(1)(b) (which relates to an order under section 44) permitted service on a non-party. He reviewed the authorities which had considered the question whether section 44 permitted orders against non-parties, noting the views of judges either way. Males J concluded that the better view was that section 44 did not include the power to make an order against a non-party. His reasons were set out at [48] to [50] of his judgment which Foxton J quotes in full. </p>

He then went on to consider the other case which particularly influenced his approach, the decision of Sara Cockerill QC (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">DTEK Trading SA v Morozov</span> [2017] EWHC 1704 (Comm); [2017] Bus LR 628. That case concerned an application for permission to serve out under CPR 62.5(1)(b) in respect of an application against a non-party under section 44(2)(b). In that case, the judge considered the arguments challenging the conclusion of Males J in <span style="font-style:italic">Cruz City</span> but, having referred to the terms of section 44 itself and the authorities, she concluded at [56] that whilst there was plainly an argument as to the issue, she was clear in her own mind that the right answer was the one Males J had reached.  </p>

Those parts of s.44 which are suggestive of orders against arbitrating parties might reflect the fact that this was the dominant, but not exclusive, focus of the drafter. The fact that court injunctions can have legal force against non-parties even when the order is not made against them (as the Departmental Advisory Committee on Arbitration Law recognised in paragraphs 214 to 216) reflects the fact that a court order will engage interests, and give a right to be heard, to non-arbitrating parties, and will therefore necessarily involve a fundamental departure from the bilateral nature of consensual arbitration. For example, a court injunction against an arbitrating party can place a non-party who interferes with it in contempt of court, and a non-party affected by the order has the right to apply to vary or discharge the order. A power to make an order directly against a nonparty would go further than this, but it might be said only incrementally.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Foxton J then dealt with the two grounds upon which the appellants sought to distinguish that reasoning, the first of which was that section 44(2)(a) extends to nonparties because it refers to the taking of the evidence of witnesses, even if that was not the case for the other subsections. The judge rejected that argument for three reasons. First, the language and structure of the section, the introductory words of section 44(1) and the provisions on which the Courts had placed emphasis in <span style="font-style:italic">Cruz City</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">DTEK</span> apply to all the powers in section 44(2). The judge did not regard the argument that some of the powers could be exercised against non-parties whereas others could not as an attractive one in the absence of language in the section justifying differential treatment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the judge considered that in so far as Sara Cockerill QC in <span style="font-style:italic">DTEK</span> at [47] noted that section 44(2)(a) was concerned with the English Court issuing letters of request to foreign courts for the taking of evidence of non-parties, those are not coercive orders directed at a non-party but a request made of a foreign court which may or may not exercise its own coercive powers over the non-party potential witness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Third, applications for coercive orders against non-party witnesses might be said to raise additional complications. If the power is the same as in relation to legal proceedings, it might suggest powers equivalent to CPR 34.8 but that does not have coercive effect. If the witness does not attend, the examiner fills in a certificate of non-attendance at which point the party seeking the deposition can apply to the Court for an order under CPR 34.10 requiring the witness to attend. Failure to attend is then a contempt of Court. Foxton J considered that if section 44(2) orders could not generally be made against non-parties it would be surprising if coercive orders could nonetheless be made against non-party witnesses under section 44(2)(a) when section 43 already makes specific provision for securing the attendance of witnesses with the two limitations that the provision is limited to securing the attendance of witnesses before the tribunal rather than an examiner and that the arbitral proceedings must be being conducted in this jurisdiction.  </p>

At [31] Foxton J noted that the submission that the difficulties in seeking section 44 relief against non-parties only arise where the application must be served outside the jurisdiction mirror the view expressed at 44.7.5 of Merkin and Flannery on the Arbitration Act 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> edition. The judge disagreed with that view, concluding at [33] that: “the position is not that applications against non-parties under s.44 have failed because it is not possible to serve those applications out of the jurisdiction. It is that applications to serve s.44 claims against non-parties out of the jurisdiction have failed because s.44 has been held not to apply to non-parties.” </p>

His reasons for that conclusion were: (i) the issue of the “signature bonuses” was clearly an issue of importance in the arbitration; (ii) the third respondent had been the lead commercial negotiator for the first and second respondents of the relevant agreement, involved in negotiating the signature bonuses; (iii) although the negotiations were over twenty years ago, there was sufficient prospect of the third respondent having relevant evidence to give, even if only that nothing memorable happened; (iv) the tribunal had already heard evidence from another person involved in the negotiations, Z, assistant general counsel. However, given their different roles, there was a sufficient possibility that the third respondent had relevant evidence to give, notwithstanding that Z had given evidence; (v) while the respondents’ points as to why the third respondent’s evidence is unlikely to add to that of Z may prove to have weight, it would not be appropriate for the Court hearing a section 44(2)(a) application to delve too deeply into the evidence given to date or to assess the relative weight of evidence, which was a matter for the tribunal. </p>

The judge indicated that if he had been prepared to make an order, it would have been broadly along those lines. </p>

Sections 43 and 44 were in a part of the Act beginning at section 42 headed “Powers of court in relation to arbitral proceedings”. Section 43 was concerned with securing the attendance of witnesses because the tribunal did not have power to compel attendance of witnesses. The powers under section 43 were limited geographically to witnesses in the United Kingdom and to making orders where the arbitral proceedings were being conducted in England and Wales, but were otherwise exercisable against all witnesses, not just party witnesses. </p>

In answer to a point taken by the third respondent that it would be surprising, if section 44(2)(a) applied to non-parties, that the DAC does not say so, Mr Lissack QC submitted that the surprise is the other way. Section 44(2)(a) is the successor of section 12(6)(d) of the Arbitration Act 1950 which did apply to non-party witnesses: see per Clarke J in <span style="font-style:italic">Unicargo v Flotec Maritime (The Cienvik) </span>[1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 395 at 404 rhc.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Lissack QC submitted that the starting point for section 44 is not the consensual nature of the arbitration agreement but what powers the Court is to have. The opening words of subsection (1) were just making it clear that the provision was nonmandatory, so that the parties to an arbitration agreement can contract out of giving the Court the section 44 powers. Where the parties do not contract out, the Court has the powers, subject to the other subsections. Contrary to the submissions on behalf of the third respondent, subsection (1) does not limit the powers given to those which the Court has in relation to foreign proceedings. The Hague Convention and the 1975 Act were irrelevant. Focusing on what he described as the narrow question as to the scope of section 44(2)(a), irrespective of the scope of the other subsections, he submitted that subsection (2)(a) gave the Court the same power in relation to taking of evidence from a witness for an arbitration as the English Court would have in civil litigation before the English Courts. Because of section 2(3)(b) these powers could be deployed in aid of a foreign arbitration as well. One of the powers given to the Court in civil litigation was the power to order a deposition to be taken before an examiner under CPR 34.8 and, accordingly, Mr Lissack QC submitted that, whatever the scope of the other subsections, section 44(2)(a) combined with section 2(3)(b) meant that the Court had jurisdiction to make such an order in aid of the New York arbitration, as MooreBick J had held in <span style="font-style:italic">Commerce &amp; Industry Insurance</span>.  </p>

The appellants’ argument ignores this language and the paramount concept which lay behind the 1996 Act of party autonomy, enacted as one of the principles in section 1(b). This was also clear from section 44(4) which provides that other than in cases of urgency, the Court can only act with the permission of the tribunal or the agreement of the parties to the arbitration. Since a third party in the position of the third respondent was not a party to the arbitration and had no locus to address the tribunal as to whether such permission should be granted, the powers of the Court under the section were only those directed against the parties, not a non-party. </p>

She submitted that section 44(2)(a) was not intended to deal with compulsion of evidence. There was no mention of compulsion of evidence in the DAC Report in relation to section 44 at [214]. Furthermore, the DAC Report made clear at [25] in relation to section 2(3) the extension to foreign arbitrations was giving effect to the DAC recommendation that section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 should be extended to arbitration proceedings.

Ms Welsh sought to address this issue of the limited effect which this construction, that the subsection was not concerned with compulsion of evidence, would place upon the subsection by submitting that the power under the subsection could be used where a witness was willing to give evidence but for example one of the parties to the arbitration sought to prevent the witness giving evidence because of a non-disclosure agreement or where someone was trying to intimidate a witness.  </p>

If, contrary to her primary position, the subsection did give the Court power to order a deposition, that power should be limited in the same way as it would be in civil proceedings where it could only be ordered in English court proceedings, in other words it should be limited to domestic arbitrations.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Second, the words “the taking of the evidence of witnesses” are apt as a matter of language to cover all witnesses, not just those who are a party to the arbitration. Indeed, as Males LJ points out in his judgment, in the context of modern commercial arbitration, it is rare for a witness also to be a party. Furthermore, as Mr Lissack QC correctly submitted, the statute clearly distinguishes between a “party” and a “witness” when it is necessary to do so: see section 38(5) and section 43(1). There is no basis for construing “witnesses” in section 44(2)(a) as synonymous with “parties”. Equally, there is no justification in the wording of the statute for limiting “witnesses” to those who are in the control of one or other of the parties. If Parliament had intended that limitation, it would have said so.  </p>

There is nothing in the point that the English Court could not order a deposition in support of foreign court proceedings, but could only issue a letter of request under section 1 of the 1975 Act. Ms Welsh’s submission to that effect asks the wrong question: the question under section 44(2)(a) is not what power the English Court would have in relation to the taking of evidence from witnesses for the purpose of foreign court proceedings but what power it would have in relation to civil proceedings in the High Court or the county court, where clearly the Court’s powers are not in any sense limited by reference to the Hague Convention or the 1975 Act.     </p>

There is simply no justification for reading into “the taking of the evidence of witnesses” a limitation that it excludes depositions when the power to order a deposition is one of the powers the English Court would have in civil proceedings before the High Court or the county court. In any event, there may be less of an anomaly than appears at first blush given that (a) on the basis that a case where this form of order is sought is unlikely to be one of urgency, so that unless the parties are agreed, the party seeking to depose a witness will need to obtain the permission of the tribunal under section 44(4) to make an application; and (b) the Court always has a discretion under section 44 as to whether to make an Order under section 44(2) and, in the cases of a foreign arbitration has a specific discretion under section 2(3) not to make an Order if it considers it inappropriate to do so. </p>

The opening words of section 44(1) and the terms of section 44(4) provide what are, in effect, thresholds or gateways which have to be satisfied before the Court can exercise its powers, that the parties have not agreed to contract out of the Court having the powers and that, save in the case of urgency or agreement between the parties, any application to the court is made with the permission of the tribunal.

However, in practice, that anomaly may be more apparent than real, in the sense that where a third party objecting to the making of an Order against him or her under section 44(2)(a) raises an issue of principle, as in the present case, the judge at first instance is likely to grant permission to appeal, as Foxton J did. In any event, even if there is this anomaly, it is not such as to justify giving section 44(2)(a) the restrictive interpretation suggested on behalf of the third respondent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fifth, Ms Welsh submitted that the power to order a deposition should be narrowly construed because the power is generally only used in limited circumstances, such as where the witness is unfit or otherwise unable to attend the trial and, even then, in the modern context, it is more common for such evidence to be given by video-link. I see no reason to construe the power narrowly merely because it may be used in practice relatively rarely. The question whether to exercise the power in a particular case is one which goes to discretion not to jurisdiction. Nothing in the wording of CPR 34.8 itself suggests that it bears or should bear the narrow construction for which Ms Welsh contends. Nor is there anything in the point that an Order under CPR 34.8 is not coercive unless a subsequent Order is made under CPR 34.10. Both forms of Order are within the powers that the Court has in relation to civil proceedings in the High Court or the county court.  </p>

Whilst it could apply to an outward letter of request to a foreign court in support of arbitration proceedings in England and Wales, it is difficult to see in what practical situation such a letter of request would ever be made in support of an arbitration seated abroad. Ms Welsh suggested the subsection would cover orders preventing a party from interfering with witnesses or ordering a party to permit a witness to give evidence who had signed a non-disclosure agreement. However, neither of those situations is commonplace and, as Males LJ says in his judgment, there is no reason to think Parliament had them in mind in enacting subsection (2)(a). </p>

The issue in the case was whether the court had jurisdiction to make a freezing order in aid of enforcement of a London arbitration award against subsidiaries of the award debtor against whom no substantive claim was asserted and who had no presence or assets within the jurisdiction; and, for that purpose, whether those subsidiaries could be served pursuant to CPR 62.5(1)(c) on the basis that the claim form sought a “remedy … affecting an arbitration (whether started or not), an arbitration agreement or an arbitration award".

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First and obviously, subsection (2)(a) is concerned with taking the evidence of witnesses. But it will be relatively rare, at least in commercial arbitrations, for a witness also to be a party. That will only be the case where an individual is a party to the arbitration agreement. The subsection draws no distinction between witnesses who are under the “control” of a party, whether because they are employees or for any other reason, and those who are not, while even those who are under the control of a party may nevertheless be reluctant to give evidence. So the paragraph is clearly directed towards obtaining the evidence of individuals who are not parties to the arbitration. It would make no sense to conclude that Parliament intended this paragraph to apply only when an individual happens to be a party to the arbitration. Indeed, in such circumstances, invoking the power of the court would be unnecessary or impossible. Plainly paragraph (a) is not there to enable one party to go to court to obtain either his own evidence or the evidence of the other party. </p>

Undoubtedly one such power is the power in CPR 34.8 to order that a witness’s evidence be obtained by way of a deposition before a judge or an examiner of the court. It is fair to say (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Cockerill, The Law &amp; Practice of Compelled Evidence</span> (2011), para 1.08) that this power is generally used in limited circumstances, typically where the witness is unfit or otherwise unable to attend the trial, and that the norm is for witnesses to give their evidence before the judge at the trial, either by attending in court or by video link. Ms Welsh submitted that the power to order a deposition under CPR 34.8 should as a result be narrowly construed. I do not accept this submission. It is more accurate to say that the power is a broad power, used in practice in limited circumstances, and that the court has a discretion, subject to the provisions of CPR 34.8 and 34.9, to determine the circumstances in which it should be exercised. </p>

The fact that the court also has other powers, such as the power to issue a letter of request seeking the assistance of a foreign court to obtain the evidence of a witness present within the jurisdiction of that court, which does not require the court to make an order against the witness, does not detract from this conclusion. </p>

She pointed out that, as held in <span style="font-style:italic">Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation v Westinghouse Electric Corporation</span> [1978] AC 547, this Act provides a complete code in that respect.

Ms Welsh submitted that the position could be no different when the evidence is to be given, not in support of foreign court proceedings, but in support of a foreign-seated arbitration. That is a formidable submission, but in my judgment it poses the wrong question. Under section 44 of the Arbitration Act, the question is not whether the English court would have power to order a deposition outside the scope of the 1975 Act in support of foreign court proceedings, but rather whether it has power to order a deposition in support of legal proceedings in this country. That is the necessary consequence of the correct understanding of section 44(1) as I have explained it above.  </p>

However, this anomaly (if that is what it is) does not in my view undermine the conclusion which I have reached. The Arbitration Act provides sufficient protection against misuse of the power to order a deposition in the need for the court to consider the appropriateness of making an order in the case of a foreign-seated arbitration (section 2(3)), in the requirement contained in section 44(4) for the permission of the tribunal or the agreement of the parties before an application can be made, and in the court’s discretion whether to make an order in any particular case. </p>
