	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is an appeal from an order of HH Judge Pelling QC (sitting as a judge of the High Court) dated 20 February 2019 by which he dismissed a claim against solicitors for damages for negligence.  The judge held that the solicitors had been negligent in failing to register a restriction at HM Land Registry in order to protect the claimants’ interest in a contract to purchase a freehold property at 8 Denny Crescent, London, SE11 (“the Property”) which was subsequently sold to a third party without their consent.  But he held that they had not established that the negligence had caused them any loss.  The claimants appeal against his order with the permission of Davis LJ.  The defendants, by respondent’s notice, challenge the judge’s finding that the claimants are entitled to rely on the extended limitation period provided for under s.14A of the Limitation Act 1980 (“LA 1980”).  If they are right about that then a further issue arises as to whether the six-year period of limitation under s.2 LA 1980 commenced in 2003 when the breach of duty occurred or much later on 29 October 2010 when completion of the sale of the Property took place.  The claim form was issued on 26 October 2016.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although the appeal therefore centres on these limited issues of causation and limitation, the relevant factual background is both lengthy and not uncomplicated.  I propose therefore to begin by setting out a summary of the facts in order to explain how the issues which we have to decide arose.  Where necessary I will refer to some aspects of the evidence in greater detail when I come to consider the particular issues to which they relate. </p>

When he was only three weeks’ old his mother gave him up for adoption.  He was subsequently adopted at the age of three months and grew up without knowing the identity of his biological mother.  As an adult he moved to Australia where he met his future wife.  They came to England for several months in September 1990 and during that time Professor Gosden began the searches and inquiries which led to the identification of Dr Weddell as his mother and to their being re-united.  The claimants returned to live in England in 1994.  </p>

These included a sum of £40,000 which was used to pay off the mortgage on their house in Australia.

There was an obvious problem about Inheritance Tax (“IHT”).  Her accountant referred her to St James’s Place Plc (trading as St James’s Place Wealth Management (“SJP”)) which was marketing a scheme for the mitigation of IHT known as the Estate Protection Scheme (“EPS”).  The scheme was designed to enable the owners of property (typically their principal family home) to dispose of the property on terms which enabled them to continue to live there until death but which reduced the value of the property in their estate for IHT purposes. </p>

The Property Trust was set up with an initial capital sum of £10 and gave the owner of the Property (as settlor and principal beneficiary) a life interest in the settled property with gifts over to his or her children or remoter issue subject to an overriding power of appointment in favour of the settlor during his or her lifetime.  The contract for the sale of the property was not intended to be completed until 10 years beyond the expected life of the settlor so as to avoid the payment of stamp duty in the meantime.  As part of the scheme the settlor was also granted a licence to continue to occupy the Property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Although the interest in possession granted to the settlor under the Property Trust meant that the value of the property would be included in the settlor’s estate for IHT purposes, the thinking behind the EPS seems to have been that the value of the property would fall to be reduced by the amount or value of the loan note used as consideration for the sale.  The loan note itself was settled under the EPS on the terms of a “Family Trust” under which the settlor would not be a beneficiary but his or her children and remoter issue would be.  The gift of the loan note by the settlor into the Family Trust would constitute a transfer of value for IHT purposes but would cease to be taken account of as part of the settlor’s estate after 7 years. </p>

The effect of FA 2004 was to introduce a charge to income tax on the value of Dr Weddell’s right to continue to occupy the Property.  In response to these tax changes, Halliwell Landau wrote to each of its clients who had used the EPS advising them of the possibility (and the tax consequences) of carrying out what was described as a partial unravelling of the scheme so as to release the liability under the bond used to provide the consideration for the sale of the Property to the trustees of the Property Trust.  The intended effect of this unravelling was that the Property should revert to being treated as part of the settlor’s estate for IHT purposes, in which case the charge to income tax introduced by FA 2004 would cease to have any application to the settlor’s continued occupation of the Property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Dr Weddell, however, declined to do this.  In a letter to Halliwell Landau of 10 May 2005 she indicated that, having discussed the matter with her family, she had decided that the best option for her was to pay the income tax charge and to leave the EPS arrangements in place.  The judge said that these events in 2005 confirmed that a close family relationship continued to subsist between Dr Weddell and Professor Gosden and that she remained ready, willing and able to discuss issues concerning the Property with the claimants.  But he also inferred that the decisions which she then made about the Property were hers alone.  The judge goes on to say that the exchanges with Halliwell Landau and the claimants about the impact of the FA 2004 charge to income tax also showed that Dr Weddell knew and understood that the EPS itself could be “unravelled” as and when she chose.  This is not entirely accurate.  What Dr Weddell would have known from reading the “Choices” document was that the sale of the Property to the trustees could be reversed by appointing to her the benefit of the contract.  The exercise of the clause 3.2 power would not necessarily have involved the trustees taking into account the interests of the infant beneficiaries under the Property Trust, although they could have done so: see the provisions of clause 3.2 quoted at [11] above.  But it would nevertheless have required the consent of the claimants as trustees.  A decision by Dr Weddell to leave the trust arrangements in place and to pay the income tax was something that, on the evidence, she could afford to do and was a decision which she could take herself.  A decision by the trustees to in effect terminate the EPS by appointing the benefit of the contract back to Dr Weddell was a very different matter.  It did require the consent of all the trustees and had much wider implications for both the claimants and for their children.  </p>

She met Dr Weddell through mutual friends.  She had been in a relationship with Miss Jean Southworth QC but by 2006 Miss Southworth had become very ill and, according to Ms Cook, their relationship was by then purely platonic.  However, her relationship with Dr Weddell developed to the point where in May 2007 they entered into a civil partnership.  The judge found that from this time onwards the ties between Dr Weddell and the claimants became more distant particularly after Dr Weddell moved to live with Ms Cook at a house on the Isle of Wight in 2010. </p>

Their case was that she manipulated her relationship with Dr Weddell and took advantage of Dr Weddell’s deteriorating physical and mental health so as to turn her against the claimants.  Ms Cook’s evidence was that the deterioration in relations began at a lunch at the claimants’ house in Oxford during a visit there by Dr Weddell in January 2007 while she (Ms Cook) was in Ireland and continued at a lunch at the Property in February 2007 when she was present.  </p>

This prompted Dr Weddell to disclose to the Professor Gosden that the relationship between her and Ms Cook was more than a friendship.  Dr Weddell was said by Ms Cook to have been very upset by the thought that her son might try to put her into a home.  The claimants’ evidence was that there was a discussion in which Dr Weddell informed Professor Gosden that she and Ms Cook wished to get married and that it was what Professor Gosden described as a “very odd encounter”.  But he denied that there was any suggestion of Dr Weddell going into a home or any unpleasantness as a consequence.  The judge rejected Ms Cook’s evidence of the conversation and said that he found Professor Gosden’s evidence on this issue to be entirely convincing.  He added that he proposed to treat Ms Cook’s evidence with caution save where it was corroborated, admitted or contrary to her interests. </p>

In 2010 Dr Weddell moved, as I have said, from the Property to live with Ms Cook at a property on the Isle of Wight called Dolphin Cottage.  Ms Cook said (and the judge accepted) that this property was more suitable because of Dr Weddell’s mobility issues, although that later changed.  But the claimants’ case was that from 2006 or 2007 onwards Dr Weddell lacked the capacity to make serious decisions about her affairs and that this would have justified their refusing to agree (had they been asked) in 2010 to unravel the EPS trusts and to a sale of the Property. </p>

He therefore considered that he was bound by s.1(2) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to assume that she had capacity.  But, as Davis LJ observed when granting permission for this appeal, that cannot be conclusive of whether the claimants would have given their consent in 2010 for the exercise of the power of appointment or for a sale had they been asked by or on behalf of Dr Weddell to do so.  The claimants’ case on this appeal is that the judge should also have taken account of the fact that (rightly or wrongly) they in fact believed that Dr Weddell lacked the necessary capacity and was being manipulated by Ms Cook.

Ms Cook was cross-examined about this at some length during the trial but the judge accepted her evidence that she had not deliberately excluded the claimants from contacting Dr Weddell.  Reliance was placed on the fact that there have also been proceedings against Ms Cook in relation to the validity of Miss Southworth’s will under which she received 60% of the residue of her estate.  But those proceedings were eventually compromised in 2015 with the result that the estate was administered in accordance with the terms of the will.  The judge also found, as I have said, that Dr Weddell did have testamentary capacity at the time of making her own will in 2010.  He said (at [51]) that there was no evidence that her mental capacity deteriorated significantly between the making of the will and the sale of the property later in 2010.  He therefore inferred that she did have capacity to give instructions for the sale and that although the conveyancing file no longer exists, there was nothing to indicate that the solicitors who were instructed raised any concerns about the matter.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">But the significance of the distrust between the claimants and Ms Cook and of their doubts about the capacity of Dr Weddell to give instructions for the sale of the Property lies in the effect which those concerns would have had on any request by Dr Weddell to sell the Property free from the constraints imposed by the restriction on the register of title and the trusts created under the EPS.  It is to be assumed that had Dr Weddell been asked to explain why a sale was necessary and what, if any, arrangements would replace the EPS trusts she would have disclosed that her 2010 will had made the provision I have described for her grandchildren but that otherwise Ms Cook would be the only beneficiary of her estate.   </p>

Had the restriction been registered as it should have been, its existence would have come to light when the purchaser’s solicitors made the usual Land Registry searches and they would have required its removal in order for the sale to proceed.  This would have led to a discussion between Dr Weddell and the claimants in which their consent would have been sought to a sale.  The judge said that what the claimants therefore had to prove was that they had a real or substantial chance that, following the discussions, Dr Weddell would have agreed to postpone or cancel the sale.  </p>

The question as to how they would have responded had such a request then been made was therefore entirely hypothetical.

As to that, the judge considered that her priorities are likely to have changed following her civil partnership with Ms Cook in 2007 and her subsequent dependence on her for her care.  Confirmation of this was provided, he said, by the terms of her 2010 will.

Professor Gosden in his evidence in cross-examination made it clear that the Property had been a much loved family home for Dr Weddell which she was anxious to pass on to her family by means of the EPS.  He did not believe that moving to the Isle of Wight was necessarily in her own best interests.

The EPS trusts had been how Dr Weddell wished to arrange her affairs, the Property was important to Professor Gosden and she was suspicious about Ms Cook’s intentions in respect of Dr Weddell’s assets.  She would not therefore have agreed to unravel the trusts or to a sale of the Property.  None of this was really challenged in cross-examination.  It was put to Professor Kaye that in relation to financial and inheritance matters, including as between Dr Weddell and Professor Gosden, she would have stepped back and agreed with her husband.

It might then be said that the prospect of persuading her not to sell the Property represented a chance which they had lost due to the respondents’ failure to register the restriction.  But that is not how their claim was formulated.  It was pleaded and presented on the basis that what they had lost through the respondents’ negligence was the power to veto the sale.  Had Halliwell Landau registered the restriction in accordance with the duty of care which they owed to the claimants, no sale could have taken place without their consent.  The claimants’ case is not that they had a real or substantial chance of persuading Dr Weddell not to go ahead with the sale.  It is that they would not have given consent to a sale or to an exercise of the clause 3.2 power of appointment in the circumstances prevailing in 2010.

Dr Weddell decided to pay the additional tax involved and to leave the EPS arrangements in place.  The claimants were not called upon to make any decision of their own.  The decision which Dr Weddell made was one which merely served to confirm her intention that the trusts and the contract should remain in place.  </p>

By that time Dr Weddell had gone to live with Ms Cook on the Isle of Wight.  There had been the significant diminution in contact between Professor Gosden and his mother as I described earlier and a corresponding concern on the part of both claimants about Dr Weddell’s capacity and what they regarded as the malign influence of Ms Cook in the arrangement of Dr Weddell’s affairs.  </p>

Both claimants gave evidence to the effect that they would not have given consent absent a justification for the sale and the use of the proceeds of sale which would have put those concerns to rest.  In the case of Professor Kaye, her evidence was more emphatic.  Such was her concern about Ms Cook’s influence that she would not have given her consent to the sale of the Property and the dismantling of the trust arrangements which that would involve. </p>

None of their evidence which I have referred to was in terms rejected by the judge.  Indeed, he accepts that they had the concerns to which I have referred.  In these circumstances, it is difficult to see upon what evidence the judge could properly have based his conclusion that the claimants would readily have consented to the sale.  The conclusion that this could be inferred from what happened in 2005 is untenable and the assumption which the judge makes that the claimants would readily have consented to whatever Dr Weddell wished to do with the Property because it originally belonged to her ignores the legal effect of the trust arrangements and assumes that the claimants should have regarded them and their duties as trustees as of no consequence or value.  In fact, their evidence suggests the contrary.  Recent authorities both in this Court and in the Supreme Court (which are too well-known to require citation) have emphasised the primary role of the trial judge as decision-maker and the reluctance which should be shown by appellate courts to interfere with factual findings available to the judge on the evidence.  But none of that jurisprudence has disturbed the requirement that there should be evidence capable of supporting the findings of the judge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In this case, in my view, the necessary evidential foundation for his conclusions about consent was missing.  The judge, it seems to me, fell into error by approaching the issue of causation in terms of whether Dr Weddell could have been persuaded to abandon a sale and of treating the consent of the claimants to what she decided as a given.  Instead, as I explained earlier, he should have regarded the likelihood of the claimants giving consent as the primary issue.  The claimants’ evidence, put at its lowest, was that they would not have considered agreeing to a sale and to the end of the EPS arrangements without being given an explanation or justification for the sale and the use of its proceeds which both indicated that the sale was the product of an independent, informed decision by Dr Weddell and was in her own best interest.  The judge heard no evidence from Ms Cook or any other witness which allowed him to conclude that in 2010 any such justification could have been given.  Ms Cook gave no evidence as to who had made the decision to sell or the reasons for it.  Any explanation which she might have given would also need to be treated with considerable caution given that she was the ultimate beneficiary of the proceeds of sale and that much of her evidence had been found to be unreliable.  On the evidence which he did hear the only realistic and proper conclusion available to the judge was that the claimants would not have consented to the sale.  The judge was therefore wrong in my view to have held that the defendants’ negligence had not caused the claimants any damage. </p>

Professor Kaye sent an email on 22 April 2015.  SJP told her that there was no evidence that Dr Weddell had unravelled the trusts but that they would need to obtain the relevant files from storage.  On 30 April 2015 SJP confirmed that there was no sign of the trusts being unwound and suggested that the claimants should contact Mr Laidlow at his new firm (Gateley LLP).  It was at this point that Professor Kaye made the internet search which revealed that the Property had been sold.  She then told Professor Gosden that she had been in contact with SJP who had confirmed that the trust remained in existence.  The sale of the Property therefore, as she put it, made no sense.  She therefore contacted Mr Laidlow on 27 May 2015 and asked him to act on their behalf and to take what she described as immediate steps to realise the benefit under the trusts.   </p>

At this stage no mention was made of the failure by Halliwell Landau to register the restriction or of any claim which might exist in respect of that, even though Mr Laidlow (and presumably Gateleys) knew that Halliwell Landau had failed to register the restriction.   </p>

This outlined the results of various searches which Gateley had made (including a bankruptcy search against Ms Cook) all directed to the recoverability of the proceeds of sale.  Mr Seed also outlined the claims which could be brought against Ms Cook,  However, in the final paragraph of the letter he informed the claimants that because the trusts had been set up in 2003 when Dr Weddell was a client of Halliwell Landau and because Gateleys had subsequently acquired parts of Halliwell Landau’s business it was possible that a conflict of interest might exist were they now to accept instructions to take proceedings against Dr Weddell’s estate.  He said that he would confirm whether this was an obstacle to Gateleys accepting instructions once he had discussed the matter with his partners.  On 29 January 2016 he sent Professor Kaye an email confirming that his firm could not act but said that they would provide a recommendation for another firm which the claimants might then instruct.  What neither Mr Seed nor Mr Laidlow told the claimants was that no sale could have taken place had the restriction been registered by Halliwell Landau back in 2003 and that in addition to any claims which they might bring against Dr Weddell‘s estate or Ms Cook, there was also the possibility of a claim being brought against Mr Laidlow and Halliwell Landau.   </p>

It is not, nor I think could it be seriously argued, that the claimants could realistically have acquired the knowledge necessary to bring the claim without engaging the services of a solicitor.  It was submitted that the judge was wrong when he said (at [72]) that relevant knowledge of the material facts for the purposes of s.14A(6)(a) did not need to include knowledge of the absence of a restriction but was satisfied by knowledge that the Property had been sold.  But that is also untenable in my view.  Although knowledge of the sale was obviously the trigger for further enquiries about the circumstances in which it took place, the possibility of a claim against Halliwell Landau depended on at least knowing that no restriction had been placed on the register in 2003 to prevent any such sale.  Otherwise the focus of any claim would have been on the recovery from Ms Cook of the proceeds of sale and not on the responsibility of Halliwell Landau. </p>

The suggested periods range from a few weeks following the memorial service on 5 April 2013 to one of four months and a week which is equivalent to the period between Gateleys’ email of 25 January 2016 to the date in May 2016 when the claimants instructed Blake Morgan and a claim against Halliwell Landau came to be considered.  This would take the starting date to 15 September 2013.

He was therefore best placed, one might have thought, to provide the claimants with a relatively swift explanation as to what had gone wrong.  It was certainly not unreasonable for them to select him as their first port of call.  We, of course, know that he was aware that the restriction had not been registered but did not disclose this to the claimants even though it was, I think, part of his obligation to them as clients to notify them that he could not act because they might have a claim against him.  The fact that he and Gateleys chose not to make that disclosure is not something which should be held against the claimants.  They acted reasonably in first consulting Mr Laidlow and if one takes that into account then, as Ms McQuail accepts, the starting date falls after 26 October 2013.  The judge was therefore right in my view to conclude that the claimants had established their case for relying on the extended period of limitation under s.14A LA 1980.  </p>

Very shortly before the hearing of this appeal the claimants applied to amend their grounds of appeal to include a challenge to the judge’s decision that he should follow and apply what this Court decided in <span style="font-style:italic">Bell v</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">Peter Browne &amp; Co</span> even though, as I have said, it was common ground at the trial that these were the correct principles.

The accountants had failed properly to examine all the relevant documentation which would have revealed that the solicitor had misappropriated clients’ money.  In reliance on those reports the Law Society had failed to intervene in the solicitors’ practice until much later and the losses caused to the clients led to claims on the Solicitors’ Compensation Fund.  The claim against the accountants sought to recover what the Fund had paid out.  </p>

Under its rules the Fund is one of last resort and the risk of being liable for the claims was therefore contingent on the misappropriation not being made good by any other means including direct action against the solicitor.  The House of Lords held that exposure to a contingent liability was not itself damage and that for the purposes of s.2 the damage was not suffered until the contingency occurred.  </p>
