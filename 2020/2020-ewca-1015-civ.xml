	      </authorialNote> and the EL/PL Protocol<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> in 2013 (together with their associated Ministry of Justice portals) quietly revolutionised the way in which certain types of low value claims were dealt with by the civil justice system. For this purpose, a low value claim means a claim worth less than £25,000. These two Pre-Action Protocols (“PAPs”) provide a series of specific rules for the resolution of low value claims which parties are required to follow in order to achieve a quick and proportionate result, often without the need for formal court proceedings at all. Where liability is agreed but quantum disputed, a CPR Part 8 claim form must be issued, and the dispute is resolved in the county court at the so-called Stage 3 hearing. Hundreds of thousands of low value claims are resolved through these two PAPs every year.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">But what happens if, following the making of a claim under the RTA Protocol, Part 8 proceedings are started and then immediately stayed on the false premise that the claim is or remains a low value RTA claim, when it is (or should have been) obvious to the claimant’s solicitors that the claim was worth almost a hundred times more than £25,000? That is the question raised in this appeal. In the light of the many failures on the part of the appellant’s solicitors, the district judge declined to lift the stay and transfer the claim to CPR Part 7. In consequence, she struck out the claim altogether. The circuit judge upheld her order. The issue for this court is whether she was right to have done so.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">I set out the relevant parts of the PAPs and the CPR in Section 2. As with all cases where things have gone wrong during the progress of a case, it is necessary to set out the factual background in some detail (Section 3) and to summarise the judgments below (Section 4). Thereafter, in Section 5, I summarise the applicable law. In Section 6, I set out what I consider to be the right approach to an application to lift a stay of proceedings (imposed so that the parties can comply with a PAP despite limitation constraints) and/or to transfer the claim to Part 7 and/or to strike out the claim, where there are underlying allegations by the defendant of serious procedural failure or abuse of process.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Thereafter I apply that approach to the facts, in order to identify whether there was an abuse of process in this case (Section 7) and, if so, the appropriate sanction in all the circumstances (Section 8). At Section 9, I address the separate issue involving the failure by the appellant’s solicitors to comply with the order for service of the amended claim form in August 2018, and their application for relief from sanctions. The court is very grateful to both leading counsel (neither of whom appeared below) for their comprehensive written and oral submissions.  </p>

But where that does not happen, the process moves to Stage 3, which is the resolution of the quantum of the claim at a court hearing. For that purpose, the claimant is obliged to issue a claim pursuant to Part 8, and the process laid down by Practice Direction 8B. No PAP process stops time running for limitation purposes. </p>

Although an interim payment of £1,000 was made in accordance with the RTA Protocol, thereafter, throughout 2015, 2016 and the first part of 2017, progress was non-existent. It appears that the respondent continually chased the appellant’s solicitors about the progress of the claim, seeking information as to whether the appellant was off work and whether there was a loss of earnings claim, and asking other questions relevant to quantum. The respondent also sought the appellant’s medical notes. But no replies to any of these chasers were forthcoming.

They were not told that, on 26 January 2017, Dr Kidd had produced a second report which identified a deterioration in the appellant’s condition and referred for the first time to his migraine disorder. Contrary to his earlier optimism, Dr Kidd did not now think that the appellant’s condition was going to improve significantly in the future; on the contrary, he thought it had become chronic, describing the appellant as being in “a severe neurological state”. The claimant approved the amended version of this report in November 2017 but in the event neither of Dr Kidd’s reports were provided to the respondent’s solicitors until August 2018.  </p>

More fundamentally, by August 2017 the appellant’s loss of earnings was already in excess of £200,000, and the appellant’s solicitors knew or ought to have known that this claim was therefore suitable neither for the RTA Protocol nor Part 8. </p>

Although there is no clear mechanism provided in the relevant rule or the practice direction as to what should happen if a stay imposed in accordance with 8BPD paragraph 16 is not lifted, the only logical conclusion is that the action cannot proceed by any process. Paragraph 16.7 does not allow Part 7 proceedings to be commenced whilst there is an extant Part 8 claim which has been stayed. Whilst it has been described as being a claim “in limbo” and in so far as it is not disputed that a judge has a discretion in determining whether or not to lift the stay under this paragraph, it seems to me that there must be a power to strike out. In fact this is not really challenged by either counsel. It would be a concomitant part of the process involved, when the judge exercises such a discretion. For this reason it seems to me that a judge is entitled to take into account any question of abuse of process without the need for a formal application to that effect. The discretion is clearly a broad one which will require consideration of a number of factors, and I do not believe that it is necessary for the court to follow the stepped approach which might arise if there had been a challenge made under CPR 3.4. Accordingly, the judge cannot be criticised for seeking to determine whether or not the claimant’s solicitors had abused the process of court as one the relevant factors.”  </p>

In the context of this case, it is also worth emphasising before I turn to the particular circumstances that litigants should not be deprived of their claims unless the abuse relied upon has been clearly established. The court cannot be affronted if the case has not been satisfactorily proved. This aspect is obviously inter-related with whether or not a fair trial remains possible. Moreover, the fact that solicitors have signed bills that appear to be inaccurate or worse is obviously a matter for concern, but that concern does not abrogate the need for the issue of whether the bills were indeed inaccurate to be fairly resolved between the parties, if that remains possible.” </p>

It is not difficult to imagine a claim which seems at the outset to fit within the RTA Protocol and Part 8, only for a relapse or an unexpected worsening of the claimant’s condition substantially to increase the value of the claim and thereby make it unsuitable for the RTA Protocol and, by extension, Part 8.

It is not an acceptable way to conduct proceedings under the CPR. The District Judge was right to be highly critical of the conduct of the claim on behalf of the claimant”.

The second is Judge Pearce’s assumption that the principles of abuse of process (a concept which he does not mention by name but which, from his language, it seems that he had well in mind) applied to the RTA Protocol process. In his skeleton argument, Mr Browne QC suggested that this was wrong in principle, and that a failure to comply with the RTA Protocol did not amount to an abuse of process because, like all PAPs, it was concerned with pre-action events, and not proceedings before the court.  </p>

The court will take into account non-compliance when giving directions...”.

That was a case concerned with contempt of court and false statements of truth included in statements provided during the PAP process. This court found that, even though the statements were made in pre-court proceedings, the rules relating to contempt of court applied to those statements. The explanation for that can be found in the judgment of the court at [36] - [45]. Although it might be said that contempt of court proceedings are different to, and generally more serious than, allegations of abuse of process, I am not persuaded that there is any significant difference between the two as a matter of overarching principle.

Mr Allen QC was anxious to point out that this was the focus of the enquiry before DJ Campbell, and that continuing the stay or transferring the claim was a single discretionary decision, in which the allegations of abuse of process were just one factor to be considered.

In this sort of case, if a permanent stay is maintained, or an otherwise valid claim is not transferred to Part 7 where it belongs, then the defendant will have achieved his/her aim, because the proceedings will, to all intents and purposes, have come to an end. But since it is accepted that the proceedings cannot remain in a sort of legal limbo, this approach presents the striking out as an act of kindness, putting useless proceedings out of their misery. I consider that such an approach puts the issues the wrong way round. If the defendant is seeking to prevent a valid claim from going further, then no matter the mechanism by which that debate comes before the court, the judge must grapple with the central dispute: should the claim be allowed to proceed, or should it be struck out?

The court found that this may well constitute an abuse of process, but did not necessarily do so (see paragraph 61 of the judgment of Arnold LJ).  More importantly for present purposes, the court set out the correct approach to an application to strike out for an abuse of process. It said that it was a two-stage test. First the court has to determine whether the claimant’s conduct was an abuse of process. Secondly, if it was, the court has to exercise its discretion as to whether or not to strike out the claim (see paragraph 64).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.10in;text-indent:0.00in">“65. When I look at the entire history of this case and the way in which this claim has suddenly been presented against the evidence that was available in November 2014, January 2016 and early 2017, all before proceedings were issued and, despite that evidence, the claimant’s solicitors went ahead and sought a stay because they “intended to comply with the portal protocol”, in a case that never, ever at the time they issued the claim form could it be said would have a value of £25,000 or less. That, to me, is an abuse of process and the abuse comes from using the procedure that is available to portal claims in a case that could not be said, on any stretch of the imagination, to be a portal claim. That is why I am so critical of the claimant’s solicitors, because the way in which they have done that meant that a further twelve months went by before they had to do anything substantial and in those twelve months they did not even get any further medical evidence. They just strung it out, continued to fail to properly correspond with the defendant’s solicitors and then at the eleventh hour, two days before the stay due to expire, they make an application to transfer to part 7. That is against a background of a claimant agreeing his medical evidence during that twelvemonth period, the file being transferred to the multi-track team, somebody transferring the file up and down the country (although I cannot see why that was going on when the claim form says ‘Liverpool’ for service) and finally getting to grips with the case, a case that should have been got to grips with years earlier. It is more than just ‘do not get a grip’. I find that they have utilised that part 8 stay option in a case where they should never have used it. They should have done the right thing and dropped it out of the portal.” </p>

Nobody suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Lewis, Liddle v Atha,</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Alpha Rocks</span> that the defendant had been caused manifest unfairness by the deliberate undervaluing of the claims on the claim form or the exaggerated claims for fees, but that did not prevent a finding of abuse of process in each case. In my view, questions of unfairness are relevant to the second part of the test, namely the balancing exercise to be undertaken when considering the proportionate sanction. They are not relevant to whether or not there has been an abuse of process in the first place. </p>

Moreover, in reaching her conclusions, I consider that she made findings as to the prejudice suffered by the respondent which were not in the evidence and which were unjustified, and failed to give any proper weight to the consequences of striking out the claim and depriving the appellant of his Article 6 rights.

As both DJ Campbell and Judge Wood QC made plain, the PI Protocol is very different from the RTA Protocol. It requires a completely open approach in respect of medical treatment, experts and rehabilitation, none of which is reflected (for obvious reasons of proportionality) in the RTA Protocol<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-right:0.00in"> Thus, by way of example, paragraph 2.1 of the PI Protocol identifies its objects as, amongst other things, encouraging the exchange of early and full information about the dispute, encouraging better and earlier pre-action investigation by all parties, supporting the just, proportionate and efficient management of proceedings, and promoting the provision of medical or rehabilitation treatment to address the needs of the claimant at the earliest possible opportunity.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">There are two answers to that. First, for the reasons that I have given, I consider that the focus must be on the lost year between autumn 2017 and autumn 2018. Prior to that, the use of the ‘wrong’ Protocol was much more debateable (because it was not apparent at the outset or for some considerable time thereafter that the claim was obviously unsuitable for the RTA Protocol), and the process was taking place within the limitation period anyway. So the best that the respondent can say is that, if a proper Part 7 claim had been made in the summer/autumn of 2017, as it ought to have been, they might have agreed to a stay so that the matter could have proceeded under the PI Protocol from then on. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Secondly, I do not accept that, if the PI Protocol had been followed a year earlier, the evidence suggests that anything significant would have been done differently. By reason of the size and complexity of the claim, the parties would always have had their own experts. This was a multi-track claim and as such, as paragraph 7.2 of the PI Protocol suggests (paragraph 11 above), it would not have been appropriate for a single joint expert. It has not been suggested that any other aspect of case management (save in respect of experts) might have been done differently if a Part 7 claim had been made in autumn 2017 under the PI Protocol.  </p>

The appellant’s use of the wrong Part of the CPR has not bypassed the relevant limitation period or deprived the respondent of a limitation defence. A claim form was issued in time. Furthermore, that claim had been admitted even before the claim form was issued. Thus, there has been no loss of a defence which would otherwise have been available.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The appellant was the victim of an accident for which the defendant had long ago admitted liability. His claim was started in good time under the RTA Protocol, and he was not responsible for the catalogue of errors and delays since then. His claim form was issued within the prescribed three years. If that claim was struck out now, he would have to start all over again, this time with a professional negligence claim against his current solicitors, with all the risk and uncertainty, not to say cost, that such a claim would involve. Moreover, that would be a loss of a chance claim, which is inevitably an inferior type of satellite claim, particularly when compared to the present proceedings, which involves a claim against the primary defendant who has already admitted liability. </p>

Lord Millett’s simple statement of the need for a particular justification before a claim was struck out first time round was not cited to her. If it had been, or if the other authorities noted in paragraphs 42 – 48 above had been referred to, I am confident that a different result would have eventuated. As a result, I consider that DJ Campbell erred in law in striking out the claim. That was a disproportionate remedy in all the circumstances. </p>

Secondly, I consider that the claimant should recover no interest on his special damages for the period up until 17 October 2018.  </p>

In my view, if she was proposing and then rejecting particular sanctions, in order to conclude – as she did – that striking out was the only proper course, then she needed to explain why lesser sanctions were not proportionate. In my view, they were, for the reasons I have given.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">Mr Allen QC complained that an order for indemnity costs was not an appropriate sanction because the respondent’s costs were not very high. I reject that submission: as I put to him in argument, the fact that the respondent’s costs were not as extensive as they might have been cannot mean that an order entitling them to all of those costs up to and including 17 October 2018 was inappropriate. Otherwise, taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that only if the respondent’s costs were unreasonably high would such an order be made. That cannot follow as a matter of logic or as a matter of principle.  </p>

The first stage would be to consider whether the failure to comply with DJ Doyle’s order (ie the service of the amended claim form and the accompanying documents on 26 September 2018 rather than 4 September, as ordered) was serious and significant. The second stage would be to consider why the default occurred to see if there is a good reason for it.  It is, however, unnecessary to go further into stages 1 and 2 for the purposes of this appeal because, on behalf of the appellant, Mr Browne QC properly accepted that the default was serious and significant and that, although there was an excuse, there was no good reason for it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">The final stage of the <span style="font-style:italic">Denton v White</span> approach involves a consideration of all the circumstances of the case. The judges below took contrasting attitudes to this: at [78] of her judgment, DJ Campbell concluded that, if she acceded to a request for relief from sanctions in a case with this background, “I might as well just throw the White Book out of the window and say ‘anything goes’”. Judge Wood QC disagreed with that, but approached the application on the basis that, if the claim had not been struck out it would be because there had been no abuse of process, and it would follow that relief from sanctions ought to be granted. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">With great respect to both judges, I do not agree with either approach. DJ Campbell was entitled, at the end of a lengthy <span style="font-style:italic">ex</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">tempore</span> judgment and a long day in court, to home in on the default of the appellant’s solicitors over a lengthy period when considering all the circumstances of the case. But as I have already pointed out, the overall consequence of their default was the one year’s delay in the presentation of a fully particularised claim. Both that default, and the delay in serving the amended particulars of claim for three weeks in September 2018, could have been met by appropriate sanctions from within the White Book, rather than by its defenestration. On the other hand, Judge Wood QC was also wrong to consider that the abuse argument determined everything else: as I have explained, it was quite possible for this to be an abuse of process but for the claim not to be struck out and instead to be allowed to continue under Part 7. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">It seems to me that, when looking at the case in the round, the failure to comply with the order of DJ Doyle, was a significant default, which is only exacerbated by the unhappy history. As Lord Sumption stressed in <span style="font-style:italic">Barton v Wright Hassall LLP </span>[2018] UKSC 12, [2018] 1 WLR 1119, the service of proceedings is a critically important step.

(2) Service has a number of purposes, but the most important is to ensure that the contents of the document are brought to the attention of the person to be served (para 37).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.10in">But in my view, the failure to comply with that ‘critical factor’, together with the claimant’s solicitors’ other failures, must be weighed in the balance against two particular elements of the factual background. The first is that liability for this claim has been admitted by the respondent. That makes this a very different situation to the normal dispute about defective service, where a possible limitation defence to a disputed claim might result if the original service is set aside. The second is that, on 17 August 2018, the heart of the detailed amended claim (and certainly the reason why this was now a large multi-track claim) was provided to the respondent in the form of the medical reports and the claimant’s statement. Although that plainly did not obviate the need for proper service of the amended claim form, which was then accompanied by many of the same documents, it inevitably lessened the effect of the delay in service of those documents from 4 to 26 September 2018. </p>
