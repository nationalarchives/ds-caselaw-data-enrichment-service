This approves the “home of a pregnant woman” as being a place which is authorised for the purpose of section 1 of the 1967 Act where the treatment for early medical abortion (“EMA”) may be carried out.  The Approval was made under sections 1(3) and (3A) of the 1967 Act.

The reference to the statement of Mr Duffy at [65] of the judgment was in respect of ground 3 of the original grounds of appeal, which is not pursued at this hearing.  At [30] the court correctly noted that the expert whose evidence was filed on behalf of the respondent fundamentally disagreed with the opinions of Dr Gardner.  The court correctly stated that its only function was to adjudicate on the lawfulness of the decision under challenge and the fact that Dr Gardner and others may disagree with the views of the respondent’s experts or external bodies was immaterial in the context of judicial review proceedings.  Accordingly, there are no grounds upon which to admit these statements of Mr Duffy or Dr Gardner. </p>

Mr Duffy describes the survey as mystery shopping which “involves subterfuge and the obtaining of information under false pretences”.  The service provider and the provider organisations had no knowledge of this survey.  Mr Duffy describes this as being in contravention of ethical norms in medical research.  Women were asked to make 19 sets of calls to providers in June and July 2020.  Each woman provided false information as to being pregnant, the date of her last period, her name, date of birth and contact details.  False registration data was given when details of her GP surgery was requested.  The only truthful data provided was the address to which the abortion pills should be posted.   </p>

As a result, the decision has been made to keep the process under review and report any incidents to the regional chief midwife.  The seriousness of a relatively small number of incidents has been acknowledged and acted upon.  The court does not minimise the seriousness of any incident but of itself this email takes the issues in this appeal no further.   </p>

Developments in this field of medicine, in particular in relation to the first ten weeks of pregnancy, have since taken place.  Abortion, prior to ten weeks’ gestation, is termed “early medical abortion”.  Presently, this usually requires the taking of two medicines, mifepristone and misoprostol, either at a 24 to 48-hour interval or simultaneously.  Mifepristone (the first pill) works by blocking the hormone progesterone which is necessary for the continuation of the pregnancy, misoprostol (the second pill) causes the uterus to contract which results in the loss of pregnancy in a similar way to a miscarriage.   </p>

It is acknowledged that the MDT, including nurses and counsellors (it is possible that the MDT would include a midwife where a congenital abnormality has been diagnosed antenatally) plays an important role in supporting women seeking an abortion and in obtaining information from women.  RMPs can rely on information obtained by members of the MDT but it is DH’s interpretation of the law that the RMPs should themselves review the information before reaching an opinion, for example by considering the paperwork or speaking to members of the team.  The RMP must be satisfied that they can justify how they reached their decision in good faith if later challenged.  The opinions required under the Act are clearly those of the RMP, not of any other member of an MDT, however experienced or trusted.  DH does not think that the Act can be read to enable the opinion required to be that of another person entirely, or the opinion of a team as a whole.  An RMP may, of course, take into account the opinions and views of colleagues in forming an opinion.” </p>

First, fewer women were willing or able to travel to abortion services because of the danger to themselves in contracting COVID19 and the difficulties faced in leaving home by those with young children or living in coercive and abusive relationships.  Second, the incidence of staff illness within some providers had reduced the availability of provision of services and lengthened waiting times.  Third, abortion services themselves were being withdrawn because spare capacity was needed for patients suffering from COVID-19. </p>

This would have increased the possibility of them being infected with Covid-19 as well as tending to increase the spread of that disease.  In 2018, 131,838 EMAs were carried out in England.  Prior to the temporary change in approval of class of place, each of these women would have attended a clinic or NHS service at least once, and sometimes on 2 or more occasions.  The increased use of teleconsultation and telemedicine will therefore have a significant impact on travel and social interaction and thus play a part in reducing transmission of infection during the pandemic; </p>

This case concerned the surgical induction method of termination.  The first stage, conducted by an RMP, required administration of anaesthesia and the insertion of a catheter.  It did not terminate the pregnancy.  During the second stage, prostaglandin was administered which caused contractions leading to the expulsion of the foetus.  The medication was given by a nurse or midwife in accordance with the doctor’s instructions.  The doctor was available to be called if necessary.   </p>

He observed that the terms “termination” and “treatment” are used interchangeably (827H).

It is in my view evident that in providing that treatment for termination of pregnancies should take place in ordinary hospitals, Parliament contemplated that (conscientious objections apart) like other hospital treatment, it would be undertaken as a team effort in which, acting on the instructions of the doctor in charge of the treatment, junior doctors, nurses, para-medical and other members of the hospital staff would each do those things forming part of the whole treatment, which it would be in accordance with accepted medical practice to entrust to a member of the staff possessed of their respective qualifications and experience.” </p>

In my opinion in the context of the Act, what it requires is that a registered medical practitioner, whom I will refer to as a doctor, should accept responsibility for all stages of the treatment for the termination of the pregnancy.  The particular method to be used should be decided by the doctor in charge of the treatment for termination of the pregnancy; he should carry out any physical acts, forming part of the treatment, that in accordance with accepted medical practice are done only by qualified medical practitioners, and should give specific instructions as to the carrying out of such parts of the treatment as in accordance with accepted medical practice are carried out by nurses or other members of the hospital staff without medical qualifications.  To each of them, the doctor, or his substitute, should be available to be consulted or called on for assistance from beginning to end of the treatment.  In other words, the doctor need not do everything with his own hands; the requirements of the subsection are satisfied when the treatment for termination of a pregnancy is one prescribed by a registered medical practitioner carried out in accordance with his directions and of which a registered medical practitioner remains in charge throughout.” </p>

It was in this context of a ‘hospital’ having been designated as the place of such treatment that the concept of treatment as part of a ‘team’ was discussed (Lord Diplock, p 828C–D).  It does not follow, however, either that only a hospital may be classed as a place for treatment, or even that it will be an inevitable fact that treatment will involve a team effort.

Where pregnancy is terminated by self-administration of a drug prescribed by a doctor, who may or may not have attended an e-consultation with the patient, and where the pill can be posted to the patient, the pregnancy is not “terminated by a registered medical practitioner”.  The RMP is unable to make all material decisions and remain in control.  A patient cannot be a member of the team, there is no certainty that the patient will act in a particular way.  Neither the patient’s home nor the taking of the pill can be monitored or controlled by the RMP.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The purpose of the 1967 Act was to broaden the access of a woman to a legal termination of pregnancy, approved on a specified ground(s) by an RMP and provided in a place which was deemed safe for the relevant medical process.  In 1981, when the House of Lords was considering the issue of termination of pregnancy in <span style="font-style:italic">RCN</span>, a surgical induction method of termination requiring the administration of anaesthesia represented accepted medical practice.  Even then, it was not a requirement that a doctor would have to take part in every aspect of the procedure.  It was accepted that parts of the treatment could be carried out in accordance with medical practice by nurses or other members of the hospital staff who did not possess medical qualifications.   </p>

In each case context is vitally important.  I agree.  Context must take account not only of developments in medical science and medical practice, but also of prevailing conditions in order to ensure that the purpose of the 1967 Act is met, so as to enable women to safely access regulated services and obtain legal terminations in safe surroundings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Since the passing of the 1967 Act, developments in medical science and the practice of medicine have taken place.  The requirement of a surgical procedure for an EMA has been overtaken by the prescribing of two medicines: mifepristone and misoprostol.  As medical science has developed so too has technology.  Recognition of the latter is contained in the 2014 Department of Health Guidance which envisaged a doctor not physically seeing a woman seeking a termination, instead permitting discussion by telephone or over a webcam.  Significantly, there is no statutory requirement for either of the two doctors certifying the ground for termination to have seen or examined the woman.  The 2014 guidance acknowledged the important role played by the MDT, which includes nurses and councillors, again reflecting developing practice.  It is of note that the 2019 review by NICE on the accessibility and sustainability of abortion services recommended the use of telemedicine appointments to improve access to abortion services.   </p>

Further, the RCOG’s 2020 guidance is clear: the assessment of the gestational age of the foetus is primarily reliant on the word of the mother, ultrasound scanning is the exception rather than the norm.

It was the exercise of this power which resulted in the 2018 Approval, which has not been the subject of legal challenge in England and Wales.  A legal challenge to the exercise of a similar power in Scotland failed.  It follows that the 2018 Approval, which permitted the identification of a woman’s home as a class of place for the purposes of taking the second pill, is accepted as being <span style="font-style:italic">intra vires </span>the provisions of the 1967 Act.   </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">SPUC</span> the court determined at [33] that the RMP in charge of the treatment does not cease to be so merely by prescribing the second medication to be taken at home, any more than the RMP would cease to be in charge in a clinic by prescribing a medicine to be handed to the patient by a nurse.

It gives the Secretary of State the power to approve a wider class of places, including the home, for the administration of a particular medicine or use.  One reason for so providing is to reflect a change in circumstances which could at any time arise.  That is exactly what happened in 2020, a decision was made in the context of a public health emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The circumstances are set out above, of particular note is the evidence of Imogen Stephens and the letter of 28 March 2020 ([13] above) which identify the risks to women who were seeking EMAs in terms of their health and wider vulnerability.  It records that vulnerable women were having to seek help from online providers, outside the regulated healthcare system, thereby breaking the law and losing the safeguarding and support inherent in the process provided by regulated services.  The purpose of the 2020 Approval was to address a specific and acute medical need, in the context of a public health emergency, so as to ensure the continuance of the protection of the health of women in the context of the 1967 Act.   </p>

The Secretary of State is free to approve a class of places which are safe and hygienic, for example GP surgeries, but not a class of unregulated places, a significant proportion of which are inevitably unsafe and unhygienic.

But it is most unlikely that he would seek to define the legal effect of the draftsman's language, or to predict all the circumstances in which the power might be used, or to bind any successor administration.  Only if a minister were, improbably, to give a categorical assurance to Parliament that a power would not be used in a given situation, such that Parliament could be taken to have legislated on that basis, does it seem to me that a parliamentary statement on the scope of a power would be properly admissible.’ </p>

He was responding to a concern expressed by Anne Widdecombe MP that the provisions which were to become section 1(3A) of the </p>

First, he said that the abortion pill would not be licensed unless the Committee on Safety of Medicines was satisfied that it should be; and that it would be administered only in ‘closely regulated circumstances’.  Next, he said that is was ‘possible’ that it could be administered in a GP’s surgery, with the patient returning two days later to be given a pessary.  Finally, he said that all the new provision was seeking to do was to ensure that: </p>

On the contrary, it seems to us that Mr Clarke was deliberately seeking to leave open for decision on a future occasion the precise way in which the power might be used.  Certainly there is nothing in the nature of an assurance as to how the power might be exercised in the extraordinary and then unforeseen circumstances of the current public health emergency. </p>
