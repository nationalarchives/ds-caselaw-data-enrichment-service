	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">These two appeals, which we have heard together, raise the question of what is required “to give notice in writing of” a decision curtailing a person’s leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  In each appeal the appellant contends that he was not given notice of the curtailment decision, and that in consequence the power of the respondent, the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“the SSHD”), to curtail their leave was not validly exercised.  The SSHD contends that, as she has done all that is required of her under the relevant legislation, it is for the appellants to prove that they were not given notice, and they have no real prospect of doing so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant in the first appeal is Masud Alam.  The SSHD wrote to him on 20 October 2015 informing him that his leave had been curtailed so that it now expired on 22 December 2015 (“the October 2015 decision”).  Mr Alam says that he did not receive the October 2015 decision until it was brought to his attention in connection with unrelated judicial review proceedings in 2018.  On 26 September 2018 he lodged this application for judicial review in the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) challenging the October 2015 decision.  The proceedings ultimately came before Upper Tribunal Judge (“UTJ”) Finch at an oral hearing on 3 June 2019.  UTJ Finch refused permission to apply for judicial review in a reserved decision dated 17 June 2019.  Permission to appeal to this court was granted by Sir Wyn Williams on 17 February 2020.  </p>

Mr Rana says that he did not receive the March 2015 decision until it was brought to his attention in connection with other proceedings in 2018.  On 4 November 2018 he commenced this application for judicial review in the UT which came before UTJ Freeman on the papers. By a decision dated 7 February 2019 UTJ Freeman refused permission to apply for judicial review and certified the application as totally without merit, thereby precluding an oral hearing. Permission to appeal to this court was given by Newey LJ on 8 November 2019.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is worth noting a few points about Articles 8ZA and 8ZB at this stage.  First, it is clear that at least the special deeming provision in Article 8ZA(4) was an attempt to provide for valid service in a case like <span style="font-style:italic">Syed</span> where successive attempts to serve by recorded delivery had failed.  It allows for what the Home Office sometimes refer to as “service to file”, although it is not in any real sense service at all.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, the deeming provision in respect of failure or impossibility to give notice, paragraph (4) of Article 8ZA, contrasts with the methods of service in paragraphs (1) to (3) of that Article.  Paragraphs (1) to (3) do not expressly deem the giving or sending (as the case may be) of the notice in writing to be effective service.  In other words, they do not expressly deem the intended recipient to have received the notice.  Rather, they appear simply to list permitted methods of service.  In some contexts, provisions which state that service or the giving of notice may be carried out by a particular and specific method are treated as implicitly providing that service or notice by one of those methods amounts to good service or notice in law.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Sun Alliance v London Assurance Co. Ltd v Hayman</span> [1975] 1 WLR 177 at 185 Lord Salmon, sitting as a member of the Court of Appeal with Stephenson LJ and McKenna J said: </p>

The effect of such a provision is that if notice is served by any of the prescribed methods of service, it is, in law, treated as having been given and received.” </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It is possible that paragraphs (1) to (3) of Article 8ZA were intended to be treated as operating in the way described by Lord Salmon.  So to treat them would be to create a deemed or presumptive giving of notice where the prescribed method is followed.  I do not think, however, that this can be correct as a matter of interpretation of Article 8ZA on its own.  That is not just because it is difficult to treat paragraphs (1) to (3) as implicitly deeming receipt, when deemed receipt is dealt with explicitly by paragraph (4).  Quite apart from that, the methods of service provided for by sub-paragraphs (b), (e) and (f) of Article 8ZA(2) are not specific as to the fax number, document exchange number or couriered address to which the notice in writing must, in each such case, be sent.  It would be odd to create a necessary implication of service or notice simply because a document is sent to the person affected at an unspecified fax number.    Yet, if this is a deeming provision, the fact that the document had never in fact been delivered would be irrelevant. As UTJ Grubb pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Mahmood) v SSHD (effective service – 2000 Order)</span> [2016] UKUT 57 (IAC) (“<span style="font-style:italic">Mahmood</span>”), such an interpretation would permit the SSHD to rely on decisions which the intended recipient had never had the opportunity to consider.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, and turning to Article 8ZB, Article 8ZB(1) is plainly a deeming provision, although questions arise as to its scope and effect.  The deeming provision operates when “a notice is <span style="font-style:italic">sent</span>” in accordance with Article 8ZA.  This language is apt to cover all the methods of giving notice in writing in 8ZA(2) and (3) except that in 8ZA(2)(a) where the notice is “given by hand” and not “sent”.  Further, it does not apply where the deeming provision in Article 8ZA(4) applies.  Deemed service will arise under that provision when the decision-maker records the reasons for the impossibility or failure of attempts to give notice on the file.  Nothing is sent.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Fourthly, there is a noticeable omission in the deeming provisions associated with postal delivery.  Article 8ZB(1)(a)(i) deals only with post sent by recorded delivery <span style="font-style:italic">in</span> the United Kingdom.  Article 8ZB(1)(a)(ii) is not confined to recorded delivery, but is limited to post sent <span style="font-style:italic">outside</span> the United Kingdom.  There is thus no provision dealing with time of receipt for post sent by ordinary mail within the United Kingdom.  The only explanation proffered by counsel in this case was that the omission was deliberate so as to provide an incentive to the Home Office to use recorded delivery.  Leaving gaps in legislation seems an odd way of incentivising good practice by departmental officials.  I cannot see any real purpose in the omission. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The reason this omission of UK ordinary post matters is that it would appear that, as a result, no presumption at all applies where the notice in writing is sent by ordinary mail in the United Kingdom. To reach another conclusion one would have to read Article 8ZB(1) as if it contained two parts: the first deeming notice in writing to have been given to the person affected by following any of the specified methods of sending in Article 8ZA (thus including service by ordinary post in the United Kingdom) and the second deeming it to have been given on the specified date in the restricted class of cases expressly mentioned in Article 8ZB.  A model for effecting a distinction between service and timing exists in the language of section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978, but there is no trace of an attempt to effect such a distinction here.  Section 7, which it was not suggested could fill this gap, provides: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">A separate but related question is whether the deeming language of Article 8ZB is saying anything about the effectiveness of the giving of notice, or whether it is solely confined to deeming the time of receipt in the class of cases to which it does apply.  An argument along these lines was pursued by the SSHD in <span style="font-style:italic">Mahmood </span>as recorded by UTJ Grubb at [51], but appears to have been either abandoned by the SSHD or rejected by the judge.  In my judgment, the argument proceeds on a false dichotomy between the giving of notice and receipt of notice, which I will touch on further below. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appeal was argued on both sides, however, on the basis that the words “unless the contrary is proved” relate to both the giving of the notice in writing and the timing of its receipt.  I think that agreement was correct, and its consequence is that Article 8ZB(1) only creates a rebuttable presumption which arises if one of the methods of sending in Article 8ZA is followed.  In those circumstances, whilst it is true that the drafting leaves much to be desired, I proceed on the basis that Article 8ZB (a) deems the use of the methods of sending in Article 8ZA to be the valid giving of notice and (b) deems that notice to have given on the specified day, but leaves the person affected (or for that matter the SSHD if the need arises) free to prove (a) that he was not in fact given notice and/or (b) that it was not given on that day.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The issue which really divided the parties on this appeal was what amounts to the giving of notice.  On the most generous approach (to the appellants) to this issue, the requirement for the giving of notice could mean that the person affected must become aware of the contents of the decision.  On this approach the person affected must not only have the notice in his hands, but must also have opened the envelope or other medium by which it is delivered and read it.  The difficulty with this approach is that those who do not trouble to open their mail, or collect recorded delivery items from the Post Office, or look at their emails, can effectively insulate themselves from being given notice.  HHJ Blackett tried to explain how such an approach would work in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Rahman) v SSHD</span> [2019] EWHC 2952 at [20] where he said: </p>

That is the case for good policy reasons. However, the presumption that it was “given” can be rebutted if the contrary is proved.  In my view proving the contrary is not limited to proving that the notice was not sent to the address provided for correspondence. In my view “proving to the contrary” means that, where the person has not acted in bad faith (that is for example by moving address to avert detection and deliberately not informing the Home Office), demonstrating that he was not given, in the sense of being made aware of the notice, would be sufficient to prove the contrary.  As the whole purpose of section 4 of the Immigration Act 1971 is to ensure that a person affected must be told the decision so that he or she may be able to act upon it, such a narrow interpretation would frustrate that purpose.” </p>

In oral submissions, however, he did not support the good faith/bad faith distinction.  In my judgment he was right not to do so, both because there is no basis in the language of the 2000 Order for such a distinction, and because the resultant approach is unworkable.  Mr Biggs did recognise, however, that that the court would be unlikely to accept that a person affected had not been given notice when he had had the envelope in his hand but declined to open it. </p>

Receipt of an email, for example, will be effected by the arrival of the email in the Inbox of the person affected.  Likewise, documents arriving by post will normally be received if they arrive, addressed to the person affected at the dwelling where he or she is living, at least in the absence of positive evidence that mail which so arrives is intercepted.

On 30 May 2019 Mr Alam applied for permission to rely on a witness statement.  Paragraphs 6 and 7 of that witness statement stated: </p>

She also noted the Adelaide Road address was the one which Mr Alam gave as his home address in his recent witness statement dated 29 March 2019.

She also took judicial notice of the practice of leaving a card giving details of how a recorded delivery item which could not be delivered can be collected ([25]), remarking that there was no record of the letter being returned.

She concluded that the witness statement went no further than to make a bare assertion that other people living at “the address” may have signed for the letter and not given it to him or that they would have told him if such a letter had been sent to “the property”.  Mr Alam had not named any of the individuals concerned or provided any supporting evidence.</p>

That dispute evaporated in this court when Mr Hansen accepted that the question for us was whether it was arguable that Mr Alam had not been given notice in writing of the October 2015 decision.  If that was so, then the SSHD’s power to curtail leave had arguably not been validly exercised and it was a proper case for granting permission to apply for judicial review.  In my judgment that concession was correct.  The court is not, in this case, concerned with an issue to which the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>test can sensibly be applied. Whether the correct approach is properly labelled “precedent fact” as that term has been used in the authorities is not therefore a matter which needs further exploration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment permission to apply for judicial review was nevertheless correctly refused in this case.  The SSHD’s case that notice of the October 2015 decision had not merely been sent to Mr Alam but delivered to him at the place where, as he accepted, he was living was a powerful one which had been fully particularised and supported by contemporaneous documents, in particular the GCID notes.  In addition, Mr Hansen drew our attention to contemporaneous guidance to Home Office officials which suggested that a second attempt at service must be undertaken if a curtailment decision is returned undelivered.  There was no suggestion in the GCID notes or elsewhere that the notice had been returned.  That all amounts to a strong case that it was received at the address where Mr Alam was living.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Against this there was nothing positive to rebut the SSHD’s case.  On the view which I have expressed as to the requirement for the giving of notice, it does not avail Mr Alam to say that that the notice did not come to his actual attention.  Indeed, to be fair, there is some corroboration for his assertion that he was unaware of the decision in the fact that his application to extend his leave was not made until 30 July 2016, the date when his original leave expired.  Had he been aware of the curtailment he would have been likely to apply for further leave within the period of curtailed leave.  The focus of the enquiry, however, is on whether the notice had been received.  As to that, there is only Mr Alam’s assertion that it would have come to his attention had it been delivered.   This was based on his belief that, because he always maintained good relations with others, his flatmates would have informed him had they received the notice.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">It seems to me that, on the material before the judge, three possibilities needed to be examined.  These were (a) that the notice had not in fact been delivered to Mr Alam’s address at all; (b) that the notice had been delivered but intercepted by a flatmate and not handed to Mr Alam; (c) that the notice had been delivered but been overlooked or left unopened by Mr Alam himself.  There was no evidence of any value to prove non-delivery under (a) and much convincing evidence the other way.  Mr Alam had himself discounted the possibility of (b) on the basis of his good relations with his flatmates.  That pointed to (c) as a likely explanation.  In a flat in multiple occupancy there are ample opportunities for envelopes (even those signed for on receipt) to go unnoticed unless proper care is taken.  There is no evidence that Mr Alam conducted any enquiries as to whether any document was delivered at around the relevant time. There is no evidence as to what steps Mr Alam habitually took to ensure he became aware of deliveries.  Mr Alam does not even describe his movements at or around the time the delivery would have occurred.  </p>
