The judge ordered the Appellant to pay to Mr Ian Marshall (“the Respondent”) the net sum of £260,000 together with the costs of the action to be assessed.

The Appellant is a General Medical Practitioner. It was admitted that the Appellant was in breach of his duty of care to the Deceased in failing to refer the Deceased to hospital following a consultation with him on the previous afternoon. It was and is, however, denied that this breach of duty caused the Deceased’s death. Subject to that causation issue, damages were agreed between the parties before the trial. </p>

She was complaining of chest pain and breathlessness. She had had a previous pulmonary embolism (“PE”) in 2008, which had occurred on a visit that she and her husband were making to friends in Edinburgh. She had been successfully treated for that PE on that occasion at a hospital in Edinburgh. The breach of duty admitted by the Appellant is that he should have referred the Deceased directly to Southend Hospital on the afternoon of 25 April. He did not do so; he examined the Deceased and told her that the most probable cause of her symptoms was muscular strain affecting her hiatus hernia.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The Deceased returned home with her husband after that consultation. She took some ibuprofen, as the Appellant had advised, and rested for the remainder of the day. The Respondent did not recall her complaining of pain during that period and he assumed that the medication, recommended by the Appellant, had worked. The Deceased went to bed rather earlier than usual, at about 2030 hours. At that stage she was somewhat breathless and negotiated the stairs to the bedroom more slowly than usual. When Mr Marshall went to bed about 2200 hours, he found the Deceased awake but sleepy. </p>

The Respondent went downstairs to make coffee; he returned with the drinks and chatted to the Deceased, including about a family wedding that they were due to attend later that day. The Deceased then went to the bathroom. The Respondent heard her calling him and sounding frightened. He rushed to attend to her and found her sitting on the lavatory in distress; she was having difficulty in breathing and was leaning upon the washbasin. She collapsed and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.5in">Heparin works by interfering with the clotting mechanism in such a way that the clot stops growing and spreading up the leg into the pelvis. New clot is more fragile and probably embolises more readily. It is likely the clot which embolised on the morning of 26 April 2014 would already have been present on 25 April 2014 and anticoagulation would not have dispersed it overnight. Heparin does not operate to dissolve blood clots. When the clot stops growing, the fibrinolytic enzymes in the blood will slowly dissolve the clot and thereby gradually reduce the risk of part of the clot detaching and causing a pulmonary embolism. Accordingly, the risk of recurrent VTE reduces progressively the longer a patient is anticoagulated. </p>

It was, in the end, common ground that heparin would have had the effect of stopping the size of the clot in the Deceased’s leg from increasing.

In the absence of any positive evidence of breach of duty, merely to show that a claimant's loss was consistent with breach of duty by the defendant would not prove breach of duty if it would also be consistent with a credible non-negligent explanation. But where a claimant proves both that a defendant was negligent and that loss ensued which was of a kind likely to have resulted from such negligence, this will ordinarily be enough to enable a court to infer that it was probably so caused, even if the claimant is unable to prove positively the precise mechanism. That is not a principle of law nor does it involve an alteration in the burden of proof; rather, it is a matter of applying common sense. The court must consider any alternative theories of causation advanced by the defendant before reaching its conclusion about where the probability lies. If it concludes that the only alternative suggestions put forward by the defendant are on balance improbable, that is likely to fortify the court's conclusion that it is legitimate to infer that the loss was caused by the proven negligence.” </p>

He noted from Casazza that the overall death rate in hospital from acute PE in that review was 3.9%. Of those haemodynamically stable at presentation only 1.4% died. Of those unstable, only 23% died. Further, the Deceased did not have a number of the other risk factors for hospital death (viz. aged over 75, 3 + days immobilisation before PE and haemodynamic impairment). Returning to the statistics from the Sekhri paper, the judge said that these indicated that the Deceased was in a sub-group with a better outcome statistically than those with RV dysfunction who had a mortality rate of 8.1%. If that was correct, her chances of survival would have been well over 90% statistically. Accepting the number of variables on the Kopcke paper, it was a proper conclusion to draw that only a very small percentage of people treated in hospital for PE do in fact die. </p>

On the facts, the judge had preferred the evidence of the expert called for the defendant whose view was that Mrs Wardlaw would not have survived. He considered that, unlike in our case, the diagnosis might not have been made on earlier referral because of the nature of the patient’s breathlessness and her general condition. Further, she had progressive PE notwithstanding adequate anti-coagulation in hospital; her condition was, therefore, unresponsive to treatment.

The failure of anti-coagulant therapy, when it was tried, to prevent the formation of a massive pulmonary embolism (which had not been present on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September) was inevitably a material piece of evidence.

Statistics do not show whether the claimant patient would have conformed to the trend or been an exception from it.

But to reject all statistical evidence out of hand would not be acceptable. This argument, if accepted, would effectually nullify the use of statistics in all cases of delayed treatment save perhaps where the figures approached 0% or 100%. Despite its imperfection, in practice statistical evidence of a diminution in perceived prospects will often be the nearest one can get to evidence of diminution of actual prospects in a particular case. When there is nothing better courts should be able to use these figures and give them such weight as is appropriate in the circumstances. This conclusion is the more compelling when it is recalled that the reason why the actual outcome for the claimant patient if treated promptly is not known is that the defendant by his negligence prevented that outcome becoming known.” </p>

He then said he was going to examine the evidence “as a whole” to assess whether or not it was more likely that she would have survived, had she been referred to hospital. Interestingly, the focus of the Appellant’s criticism here has been largely upon the answer given by the judge to question (iv), not upon the posing of that question in the first place, although the posing of the question is criticised in paragraph 1 (ii) of the appeal grounds.

The evidence of Professor Empey and Dr Gomez as to their experience, together with the literature, clearly indicated that she was most unlikely to have died in hospital.

I also reject the argument for the Appellant that to uphold the judge’s judgment would be to say that statistics are determinative of causation issues such as the present. The judge’s decision was heavily focused upon the Deceased’s condition and likely presentation at hospital. As the Appellant’s own case on the pleadings and the authorities showed, there is a legitimate place for statistical evidence in cases of this type. The employment of that evidence by the judge in this case was closely linked by him to his assessment of the evidence as to the Deceased’s own particular condition, in which her prospects of survival (on hypothetical admission to hospital) were very good indeed. I remind myself that, on the judge’s assessment (at paragraph 146) this was not simply a 50/50 case on the statistics. That will not be so in every case.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the additional paragraphs of the Respondent’s Notice (to which I have referred above) and in the skeleton argument in support, counsel argue that the overall approach adopted by the judge should have led him to find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Deceased would have survived cardiogenic shock if she had been in hospital; the weight of the evidence was all favourable. I see the force of the argument raised and it might have persuaded some judges to answer question (iii) in the positive sense. However, just as with the Appellant’s appeal, I do not feel able to find that the judge must have erred in his conclusion based on the evidence as a whole that he heard and we have not, which he expressed in paragraph 115 of his judgment </p>
