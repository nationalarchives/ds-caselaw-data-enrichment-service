They submit that the regulations imposed sweeping restrictions on civil liberties which were unprecedented and were unlawful on three grounds.  First, the Government had no power under the legislation they used to make the regulations, namely the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (“the 1984 Act”).  Secondly, the regulations are unlawful applying ordinary public law principles; and thirdly they violated a number of the Convention rights which are guaranteed in domestic law under the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”).  Although the regulations were amended on several occasions and have since been repealed, the appellants contend that it remains important that the legal issues which arise should be authoritatively determined in the public interest. </p>

This is an application for permission to appeal his order refusing permission.  When considering such an application this Court has wide powers, including the power to grant permission to apply for judicial review (rather than permission to appeal); and, if it grants permission, it may retain the substantive claim for judicial review and determine that claim itself rather than remit the case to the High Court: see CPR 52.8(1), (5) and (6). </p>

In relation to article 9 (freedom of religion), he noted that regulation 5 had been amended on the day after the hearing, 3 July 2020, with effect from 4 July.   He considered that the claim may therefore have become academic and proposed to adjourn consideration of this issue.  Subsequently, after considering further written submissions from the parties, he refused permission on this ground in an order sealed on 22 July 2020.

He concluded, first, that there was no evidence that the regulations had deprived the first appellant or anyone else of any possessions.  Secondly, the first appellant had not provided sufficient evidence that the regulations had involved any unlawful interference with his property such as would justify permitting the claim to proceed on this ground.  The judge noted that, so far as the airline leasing business was concerned, there was “simply no realistic basis on which it could be said that the regulations have caused the loss or damage to that business”.  He concluded that it was overwhelmingly more likely that the cause of any economic harm to that business was the restrictions on flights imposed by other countries; or the fact that people were unable or unwilling to fly because of restrictions or fears about the situation in other countries.  Accordingly, he refused permission on this ground and an associated application to re-amend the claim: paras 97 to 105. </p>

The test for standing is different in applications for judicial review as compared to a claim under section 7 of the HRA.  For the former, the test is whether the applicant has “a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates”: see section 31(3)(a) of the Senior Courts Act 1981.  For the latter, the test is whether the claimant is, or would be, a “victim” of the alleged violation of Convention rights: see section 7(7) of the HRA and article 34 of the Convention, to which it expressly cross-refers.  If proceedings under the HRA are brought by way of an application for judicial review, the applicant is to be taken to have a sufficient interest in relation to the unlawful act only if he is, or would be, a victim of that act: see section 7(3). </p>

Nonetheless, we make clear our serious doubts about whether it was in fact made promptly in the circumstances of this case, without relying on them to determine the application before us.  Firstly, this was a case that called for very quick action indeed given the fast-moving situation from late March.  Secondly, many third parties were potentially affected by the challenge, not least in possible criminal proceedings.  Thirdly, the issue of <span style="font-style:italic">vires</span> was one which was the subject of public debate, certainly amongst lawyers, immediately around the time that the regulations were first made in late March.  It could have been dealt with very quickly.   Fourthly, we bear in mind that one of the arguments that was made before us as to why this Court should grant permission to bring a claim for judicial review even if the case has become academic is that otherwise a claim could never be brought because the regulations have been changed many times.  If anything, that point underlines how important it is for a challenge such as this to be brought very soon after the regulations are made.  In our view, this is not a case in which it should have taken almost two months until the claim form was filed, on 21 May 2020.  </p>

The other grounds, he maintained, should not be entertained, since they would turn on the facts and, in particular, the facts as they were at the time when the regulations were made.

There is a discretion to hear disputes which have become academic but the discretion, even in the area of public law, must be exercised with caution; appeals which are academic between the parties should not be heard “unless there is a good reason in the public interest for doing so”.  By way of example (but stressing that this was only by way of example) Lord Slynn said: </p>

We have come to the conclusion that it would serve the public interest if this Court itself were to decide that issue now rather than leave it, for example, to be raised potentially by way of defence in criminal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court and no doubt on appeal from there to the higher courts.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Boddington v British Transport Police </span>[1999] 2 AC 143 the House of Lords held that a public law argument about the <span style="font-style:italic">vires </span>of an instrument in which a criminal offence is created can be raised by way of defence in criminal proceedings.  Furthermore, the question whether the Secretary of State had the <span style="font-style:italic">vires</span> to make regulations of this type continues to be a live issue even though the particular regulations under challenge have been repealed.

The true construction of these provisions, in our view, is that a special restriction or requirement is a restriction or requirement of the type which could be imposed by a justice of the peace, for example that a person be subject to restrictions on where he or she goes or with whom he or she has contact: see section 45G(2)(j). </p>

He emphasises the use of the singular “a”, “an” etc.  He accepted, as he had to, that, unless the contrary appears, the singular is taken to include the plural and vice versa: see section 6(c) of the Interpretation Act 1978.  Nevertheless, Mr Havers submitted that those references must have been, for example, to keeping children from a specific school and not the population generally from schools in England.  That submission founders, as King LJ observed during the hearing before us, on the fact that subsection 3(c) refers to “persons, things or premises” in the plural in any event. </p>

Mr Havers submits that, both as a consequence of the original regulations enacted in late March and as a result of amendments which had been made by the time of the hearing before the judge on 2 July, the position was clear: that everyone had to stay in their own home.  Mr Havers submits that this amounted in effect to a curfew or house arrest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The fundamental difficulty with that submission is that there was no deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5, in accordance with the criteria set out by the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi v Italy</span>.  In our view, it is a mischaracterisation to refer to what happened under the regulations as amounting in effect to house arrest or even a curfew.  No proper analogy can be drawn with the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">JJ</span>, which concerned control orders imposed on suspected terrorists.  The obligation to stay at home in the original version of regulation 6(1) was subject to numerous, express exceptions, which were nonexhaustive, and the overriding exception of having a reasonable excuse.   </p>

There is no such general principle.  Much will depend on the particular facts.  If it is possible for a court to say with confidence, even at the permission stage, that there was unarguably a justification for any interference with a qualified Convention right, it may properly refuse permission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first difficulty with Mr Havers’ submissions on article 11 is that he submits that the regulations must necessarily be regarded as being incompatible with article 11 in all, or nearly all, circumstances.  It is difficult to see how that can be so when the regulations themselves include the inbuilt exception of “reasonable excuse”.  That would necessarily focus attention on the particular facts of a given case in the event of an alleged breach.  In our view, the regulations cannot be regarded as incompatible with article 11 given the express possibility of an exception where there was a reasonable excuse.  It may well be that in the vast majority of cases there will be no reasonable excuse for a breach of regulation 7 as originally enacted.  There were powerful public interests which lay behind the enactment of regulation 7, given the gravity of the pandemic in late March.   </p>

Although, as Coulson LJ said,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>at para. 63, “there is no hard and fast rule”, he was right to say that it will usually be better for all parties if judicial review proceedings are not treated as “rolling” or “evolving”.  In our view, that is particularly so in a context like the present, where the regulations have been amended, sometimes very quickly, and where the issues raised by the grounds will often turn on the state of the evidence as it was at a particular time.  As we have mentioned, at one time, there was an application to amend the grounds so as to permit a challenge to be made to the regulations that were made on 3 July 2020.  Fortunately, we did not have to determine that application, since it was not pursued, but we consider that this is precisely the kind of case in which “rolling” judicial review challenges should not be brought. </p>

The Amended Statement of Facts and Grounds runs to 87 pages.  This was followed by Supplementary Grounds, which were another 13 pages.  It is impossible to see how such statements can be regarded as complying with the requirement in the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 2020, at para. 6.3.1.1: that the document “should be as concise as reasonably possible, while setting out the claimant’s arguments.  The grounds must be stated shortly and numbered in sequence”.  That Guide was published after the present proceedings were commenced but similar guidance was given in earlier editions of that Guide: see e.g. the 2019 edition, at para. 6.3.4.1.  Furthermore, this Court has, on more than one occasion, emphasised the need for a clear and succinct statement of the grounds: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Talpada) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2018] EWCA Civ 841, at para. 68 (Singh LJ). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Despite these statements, we are concerned that a culture has developed in the context of judicial review proceedings for there to be excessive prolixity and complexity in what are supposed to be concise grounds for judicial review.  As often as not, excessively long documents serve to conceal rather than illuminate the essence of the case being advanced.  They make the task of the court more difficult rather than easier and they are wasteful of costs.  It is for these reasons that skeleton arguments are subject to length constraints and so too, for example, the length of printed cases in the Supreme Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide is clear, we consider that the time has come to invite the Civil Procedure Rule Committee to consider whether any amendments to the Rules or Practice Direction governing judicial review claims are called for to contain the problem we have identified.  </p>
