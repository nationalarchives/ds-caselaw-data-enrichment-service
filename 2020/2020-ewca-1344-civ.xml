	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The background can be summarised briefly. The two boys have different fathers (the second and third respondents to this appeal, who have played no part in the hearing before us). The mother alleged that in both relationships she was the victim of domestic violence. Following the breakdown of her relationship with J’s father, there were proceedings under the Children Act 1989 as a result of which a child arrangements order was made that J should live with his mother and have supervised contact with his father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In early 2018, the family came to the attention of social services following concerns about T’s behaviour reported by the health visitor. In April 2018, the mother started a relationship with another man, KF, who himself has a child aged six by another relationship. At that point, T was aged five and J aged 18 months.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 31 May 2018, a health visitor noted marks on J’s body and as a result he was examined by a GP. Over the course of the following four weeks, J was examined by doctors on several occasions when various bruises and marks were noted on his body. At one stage, it was thought that he was suffering from ringworm or impetigo. After each examination, however, J was allowed to return home. On 22 June, J was again seen at hospital after the mother had sent a photograph of bruises and other marks on his body to the GP. On admission to hospital, a range of further bruises and marks was seen on his body, including in the genital area. Once again, J was allowed home. A further medical examination took place a week later on 29 June when further bruises and marks were seen at various points on his body. It was decided to admit J to hospital for examination and assessment on 2 July. </p>

According to the mother and KF, the mother had gone out on the evening of 30 June leaving J in KF’s care, together with KF’s child. According to KF, during the night he noticed blood coming from J’s nappy and on removing it found that he had sustained cuts to his penis and scrotum. On examining the nappy, he discovered several pieces of glass.  </p>

There followed a long series of case management hearings in which directions were given for the filing of evidence, including expert medical evidence by a number of specialists. Amongst the experts instructed were two odontologists, Dr Kouble, who had originally been instructed by the police in the course of their investigation, and Dr Crewe, who was instructed jointly by the parties to the care proceedings. Both of the boys’ fathers were joined as respondents to the proceedings and KF was joined as an intervenor. </p>

The mother, who has some cognitive difficulties, was assisted by an intermediary at the hearing. The findings sought by the local authority were that J had sustained a series of non-accidental injuries between 30 May and 1 July 2020 which been inflicted by the mother and/or KF. The mother and KF each denied responsibility for any of the injuries. In addition, the mother sought findings of domestic abuse against both of the boys’ fathers. Both men denied those allegations.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">At the hearing, the judge heard oral evidence from a number of witnesses, including several medical experts and from the mother. When KF went into the witness box, he was given a warning in accordance with s.98 of the Children Act. He then refused to answer any questions, saying that this was on the advice of his criminal legal representatives. The judge therefore heard no oral evidence from KF, although he had written evidence from him in the form of statements and transcripts of police interviews. In his statements, KF described the events of the evening of 30 June to 1 July 2018 when, while looking after the children on his own, he had noticed J bleeding in his genital area and found pieces of glass in his nappy. Following the conclusion of the evidence and submissions, judgment was reserved. </p>

He noted what he described as “a number of unanswered oddities” about her account of the events of the night of 30 June/1 July, including her failure to return home immediately after KF informed her that J had woken up screaming and that he had found glass in the nappy and cuts to his genital area. He noted that there were many areas where the mother accepted she had not told the truth. At paragraphs 198 to 199, the judge said: </p>

He acknowledged that it was necessary to look behind the convictions at the evidence heard by the Crown Court. Much of the evidence was broadly the same in both the family and criminal proceedings, but there were a number of significant differences. One example was that the mother changed her account about whether KF had been absent from the house between 17 and 25 June 2018. Importantly, unlike Judge Vavrecka, the jury heard oral evidence from KF. It was Mr Peddie’s submission to this Court that as a result the jury was therefore in a better position to view the whole canvas of the evidence.

The application notice does not extend to any other document or evidence given in the criminal trial, although in one of the skeleton arguments in support of the appeal Mr Peddie asserted that the evidence which the appellant sought to adduce included not only that report but also the evidence given by Professor Pretty and Dr Kouble in the Crown Court and the ruling by the Crown Court judge on the admissibility of the odontology evidence following a <span style="font-style:italic">voir dire</span>. </p>

In addition, Mr Peddie relies on the fact that the evidence given by Dr Kouble at the Crown Court was materially different to that given in the family proceedings and that he was less certain about his conclusions. </p>

Professor Pretty’s views do not represent a new strand of opinion in expert odontology. At one point in the criminal trial, the mother’s counsel described it as a “long-standing debate”. There was no reason why that view could not have been put before the family court judge in the fact-finding hearing. Furthermore, Ms Markham submitted that the application also failed to satisfy the second <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Ladd v Marshall</span> condition because the need for caution in interpreting forensic bite analysis was identified by Dr Kouble in his evidence in the family proceedings. Insofar as he subsequently changed his mind about some aspects of his opinion at the criminal trial, these revisions would not have affected the weight to be given to his opinion by the judge in the family court. As for the ruling on the <span style="font-style:italic">voir dire</span>, Ms Markham submitted that the approach taken by the Crown Court judge to the admissibility of the evidence in the criminal trial has no bearing on the application of rules of evidence of the family court. </p>

It is clear from the passages in the fact-finding judgment cited above that, having considered the evidence of Dr Kouble and Dr Crewe, the judge was well aware of the limitations of odontology. It may be that a third expert such as Professor Pretty may have expressed greater scepticism about the reliability of such evidence in stronger terms, but I am not satisfied that, if his report had been admitted in the fact-finding hearing, it would have had an important influence on the outcome of the case. Furthermore, the fact that there is a degree of scepticism about the reliability of such evidence was plainly known <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the fact-finding hearing. Mr Peddie may be right to suggest that it would have been difficult to persuade the judge to allow the instruction of a third expert in the field, bearing in mind the provisions of s.13 of the Children and Families Act 2014 and Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, but there was nothing to prevent the parties identifying and putting the issues to Dr Kouble and Dr Crewe in cross-examination. </p>

Counsel then instructed for the mother drew attention to concerns raised in research papers about how such analysis was carried out (see appeal bundle page 1009.43), the differences in techniques used for analysis (page 1009.48) and the absence of a universal standard for the type, qualities, and individual characteristics of a bite mark (page 1009.49). The existence of the range of opinions expressed by Professor Pretty in his subsequent report for the criminal proceedings was therefore known to the lawyers representing the parties at the fact-finding hearing and to some extent canvassed before the judge. </p>

It is the role of the court to consider the totality of the evidence, which should include an adverse inference where the law requires that inference to be drawn. Here, there was no indication why the judge did not draw an adverse inference, notwithstanding his assertion that he had been significantly hampered by KF’s refusal to give evidence. The consequences of failing to draw an adverse inference were significant. The local authority was alleging that the physical injuries sustained by J were inflicted either by KF or by the mother. If the judge had drawn adverse inferences against KF on the basis that he had something to hide, he would or should have proceeded to conclude that KF caused all the injuries, including the serious injuries to the genital area. He would thereby reach the decision arrived at by the jury in the later criminal trial. Furthermore, an adverse inference against KF would have had an impact upon the judge’s analysis of the mother’s credibility on which he relied heavily in reaching his conclusion that there was a real possibility that she was the perpetrator of the injuries. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">One example of a case where a court at first instance reopened a fact-finding hearing is my decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re Q (Fact-finding Rehearing)</span> [2019] EWFC 60. In that case, I had made findings at the first hearing that the principal injuries sustained by the child were inflicted by the father but at a subsequent Crown Court trial the jury convicted the mother of a charge relating to those injuries. Under s.11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968, in civil proceedings, including proceedings in the family court, a conviction is prima facie evidence that the convicted person committed the offence but the conviction is not conclusive and the convicted person is entitled to seek to prove the contrary. As Lord Diplock observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Hunter v the Chief Constable of West</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Midlands Police</span> [1982] AC 529 at p544D: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“it seems to me that the purpose of section 11 is principally to establish a rule to be applied in circumstances in which the criminal trial and conviction occur before the civil fact-finding process.  I accept Mr Storey's submission that it cannot have been the intention of Parliament that a subsequent conviction would lead to a presumption that a prior contrary finding in civil proceedings would be overturned on appeal …. [T]he proper interpretation of section 11 is that the weight to be attached to a conviction in these circumstances will vary depending on all the circumstances.  The proper approach in the circumstances of this case is not to rely on this conviction alone but rather to look behind the conviction at the evidence.” </p>

The gateway under CPR 52.21(2) and the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Ladd v Marshall</span> analysis concern the admissibility of evidence, while the first stage of an application for review requires a consideration of the overall merits of the application. It cannot be ruled out that the different procedures might throw up different results in similar cases, but on the whole I think that this is unlikely. In both contexts, the balancing of the public interests is carried out with a strong inclination towards establishing the truth in cases where there is good reason for a reassessment and as a result the outcomes would tend to converge.” </p>

As no application had been made to the trial judge for a reopening, this Court treated the mother as having made such an application and directed the matter be listed for directions before the trial judge so he could consider whether, and if so, how his findings of fact should be reopened.

Both applications were refused. Each application was, however, made orally, with no formal notice of application and without identifying with any particularity the evidence and other material on which it was based. In those circumstances, it is unsurprising that the applications were refused at that stage and it would not be appropriate for us to adopt the course taken by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline">Re E</span>. </p>

In contrast, they now have a transcript of much of the evidence, including the evidence given by KF. </p>

It should be recorded, however, that in the course of the hearing before us, Ms Markham indicated that the local authority would not oppose an application for a rehearing of the findings relating to the serious injuries sustained by J on the night of 30 June and 1 July.  </p>
