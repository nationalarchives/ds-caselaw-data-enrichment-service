	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal against the refusal by the High Court to grant what the judge called “a <span style="font-style:italic">de facto </span>boroughwide prohibition of encampment and upon entry/occupation…in relation to all accessible public spaces in Bromley except cemeteries and highways”. Although the stated target of the injunction was “persons unknown”, it was common ground that the injunction was aimed squarely at the Gypsy and Traveller community. The points arising from the appeal itself are of relatively narrow compass, but all parties were anxious that, in the light of the recent spate of similar cases, this court should provide some guidance as to how local authorities might address this issue in future. </p>

We refer to a number of those judgments below. One common feature of those cases was that the Gypsy and Traveller community was not represented before the court at either the interim or final hearing. Although that did not stop the judges concerned looking very carefully at the orders which they were being asked to make, I do not doubt that, in an adversarial system, there can be no substitute for reasoned submissions from those against whom an injunction is directed. </p>

There is clearly a potential issue when one takes the cumulative effect of all the injunctions granted and potentially to be granted in future into account, as to whether Gypsies and Travellers will be prevented from exercising what is recognised in both UK equalities law and human rights law to be their right to pursue their traditional nomadic lifestyle. I am told that three-quarters of the 30,000 or so Gypsies or Travellers in London are in permanent accommodation, and on the evidence there is some provision in that regard in Bromley, albeit with a shortfall based on need, but onequarter of that number are nomadic and travel rather than remaining in one place.

As the judge noted, the appellant’s answer was to say that this issue did not affect the proposed injunction in relation to threequarters of the sites, because those were owned outright by Bromley (and therefore covered by the separate claim in trespass).

Her conclusion was that it was not proportionate to grant the injunction sought. During the course of his submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Kimblin QC identified 7 factors from these paragraphs which he said comprised the critical elements of the judge’s assessment of proportionality, and which he went on to criticise in various ways. I use those 7 factors to address the bulk of the appeal in Section 6 of this Judgment.  </p>

She granted the injunction for a period of three years but with an annual review at which the council would be required to provide evidence of the steps it had actually taken to provide the said transit site. </p>

Mr Smyth's answer to this was that the Gypsy and Traveller community can occupy private land or they can go elsewhere outside the Borough. I do not regard transferring the undoubted problems the local authority has experienced to private landowners, who would themselves be entitled to seek possession orders evicting such occupants from their land, as a solution. The ‘going elsewhere’ option (which is apparently what has happened following the grant of an interim injunction) transfers the difficulties to another borough, who will then in turn invoke and seek to rely on the grant of the previous injunction to seek theirs on a “me too” approach. The problem, as I indicated before, is now the cumulative effect of all these injunctions which are reaching significant numbers and continue to be applied for by new local authorities as the problem gets transferred into their area, which means there is now more force in the argument that this is a relevant factor to be considered in deciding whether to grant the relief sought.” </p>

Some 34 injunctions to date have been granted by the courts to local authorities in similar terms (all apparently undefended). This is the first case which has had the benefit of a formal intervention, evidence and argument by leading and junior counsel on behalf of the gypsy and traveller community. The cumulative effect of such injunctions now merits consideration in circumstances where it is common ground that their grant has the effect of displacing the difficulties into the area of a nearby local authority which then applies for a similar injunction relying on those difficulties and the previous grant of such relief.           Further, injunctive relief, if it continues to be sought and granted as it has been to date, would appear to carry a risk of supplanting the existing statutory scheme for the removal of gypsies and travellers supported by government guidance. In addition, the injunctions which have previously been granted pursuant to s.187B Town &amp; Country Planning Act 1990 arguably proscribe the lawful exercise of permitted development rights. All these matters appear to me to merit appellate consideration.” </p>

The main objection to extending the order to land some distance away from the parcel which has actually been intruded upon is one of natural justice. Before any coercive order is made, the person against whom it is made must have an opportunity of contesting it, unless there is an emergency. In the case of named defendants, such as the appellants here, this need not be an obstacle. They have the opportunity of coming to court to contest the order both in principle and in scope. The difficulty lies with “persons unknown”. They are brought into the action by the process of serving notice not on individuals but on the land. If it were to be possible to enforce the physical removal of “persons unknown” from land on which they had not yet trespassed when the order was made, notice would also have to be given on that land too. That might be thought an evolution too far. Whatever else a possession order may be or have been, it has always been a remedy for a present wrongful interference with the right to occupy. There is an intrusion and the person intruded upon has the right to throw the intruder out. </p>

We should assume that people will obey the law, and in particular the targeted orders of the court, rather than that they will not. We should not be too ready to speculate about the enforcement measures which might or might not be appropriate if it is broken.

Further, as Lady Hale points out, so long as landowners are entitled to evict trespassers physically, judges should ensure that the more attractive and civilised option of court proceedings is as quick and efficacious as legally possible. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal was plainly right to seek to identify an effective remedy for the problem faced by the Commission as a result of unauthorised encampments, namely that, when a possession order is made in respect of one wood, the travellers simply move on to another wood, requiring the Commission to incur the cost, effort and delay of bringing a series or potentially endless series of possession proceedings against the same people.” </p>

One matter that needs to be addressed is whether there are lesser alternatives to such an injunction. I am satisfied that, in terms of the efficacy of preventing unauthorised encampments, there is no adequate alternative remedy. There have been plenty of instances in which the council has tried to make it more difficult to access a site. Indeed, businesses have done the same. But measures taken to prevent access have simply been torn down, gates climbed over and ignored. Actions for possession take time and also eat up further council resources. My concern, however, has been, as I said at the outset of this application, that even bearing all that in mind, there is a potential risk in this injunction that it would have the draconian impact of leaving travellers with nowhere to go within the city council of Wolverhampton's area of control. That is one of the reasons why the identification of the relevant sites is material. It appeared to me that it might be the case that the 60 sites that have been identified were the only sites that might be available to travellers within the relevant area and that, if that were the case, the net result of the injunction which was sought would be a borough-wide prohibition on travellers' sites in Wolverhampton. I have been told today, and I accept, that that is not the case and that the 60 sites identified are those that are the most vulnerable, that other sites could still be occupied, and indeed that, since this application was made, one such site not covered by the scope of the injunction sought has been the subject of an unauthorised encampment. That is a relevant consideration. </p>

The council recognises, very fairly and properly, that there is a balancing act to be carried out between the protection of sites from unauthorised encampments and the provision of facilities for those who choose to adopt, as it was put, a nomadic lifestyle. The council has therefore taken steps set out in the evidence before me to consider the provision of a transit site. In the absence of that transit site, all that is available to travellers within this area are the sites that would be unaffected by this proposed injunction. Efforts have been made to identify such a transit site, and a shortlist of three has been drawn up. I was told today that matters are progressing well in that respect. The preferred site is the fishing pool site, which is a privately owned site, and negotiations are taking place with the owner with a view to renting that site to the claimant </p>

There were a number of reasons for this, among them the delay inherent in a process of application, refusal, appeal, continued user, enforcement notice, appeal; the possibility of repeated applications, curbed but not eliminated by section 70A of the 1990 Act; and the opportunities for prevarication and obstruction which the system offered. In the case of Gypsies, the problem was compounded by features peculiar to them. Their characteristic lifestyle debarred them from access to conventional sources of housing provision. Their attempts to obtain planning permission almost always met with failure: statistics quoted by the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Chapman v United Kingdom</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2001/43.html">

For centuries the commons of England provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic. Enough common land had survived the centuries of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable, but by s.23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 local authorities were given power to close the commons to travellers. This they proceeded to do with great energy, but made no use of the concomitant power given to them by s.24 of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons. By the Caravan Sites Act 1968, therefore, Parliament legislated to make the s.24 power a duty, resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils (although the latter continued to possess the power to open sites). For the next quarter of a century there followed a history of non-compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of 1968, marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty, to apparently little practical effect. The default powers vested in central government, to which the court was required to defer, were rarely if ever used." </p>

It seems to me perfectly clear that the judge on a section 187B application is not required, nor even entitled, to reach his own independent view of the planning merits of the case. These he is required to take as decided within the planning process, the actual or anticipated breach of planning control being a given when he comes to exercise his discretion. But it seems to me no less plain that the judge should not grant injunctive relief unless he would be prepared if necessary to contemplate committing the defendant to prison for breach of the order, and that he would not be of this mind unless he had considered for himself all questions of hardship for the defendant and his family if required to move, necessarily including, therefore, the availability of suitable alternative sites. I cannot accept that the consideration of those matters is, as Burton J suggested was the case in the pre-1998 Act era, 'entirely foreclosed' at the injunction stage. Questions of the family's health and education will inevitably be of relevance. But so too, of course, will countervailing considerations such as the need to enforce planning control in the general interest and, importantly therefore, the planning history of the site. The degree and flagrancy of the postulated breach of planning control may well prove critical. If conventional enforcement measures have failed over a prolonged period of time to remedy the breach, then the court would obviously be the readier to use its own, more coercive powers. Conversely, however, the court might well be reluctant to use its powers in a case where enforcement action had never been taken. On the other hand, there might be some urgency in the situation sufficient to justify the pre-emptive avoidance of an anticipated breach of planning control. Considerations of health and safety might arise. Preventing a gipsy moving onto the site might, indeed, involve him in less hardship than moving him out after a long period of occupation. Previous planning decisions will always be relevant; how relevant, however, will inevitably depend on a variety of matters, including not least how recent they are, the extent to which considerations of hardship and availability of alternative sites were taken into account, the strength of the conclusions reached on land use and environmental issues, and whether the defendant had and properly took the opportunity to make his case for at least a temporary personal planning permission.”  </p>

In addition, I reject the submission that, because the proposed injunction did not cover private land, its width was overstated. The judge expressly dealt with that at [63].

As we have seen in relation to the permitted development point, when a lesser alternative was expressly mooted, the appellant made plain that it was not interested in any “second rate” solution. So whilst I accept that, in appropriate circumstances, a judge should consider whether the problem can be dealt with in a less draconian way, there must always be realistic limits to that exercise. A proportionality analysis requires a judge primarily to consider whether what is being proposed is proportionate in all the circumstances. The fixed point therefore is that which is actually sought, not that which might have been sought in other circumstances.  </p>

That is particularly important when they are seeking an injunction against persons unknown, when they know that the defendants will almost certainly not be represented at either the interim or final hearings. Of course the judge will want to scrutinise carefully what is being sought (and the cases referred to in paragraphs 38 and 39 above make plain just how scrupulously the first instance judges have undertaken that exercise in these cases) but, ultimately, the burden remains on the local authority. </p>

It was simply a factor that she took into account in her assessment of proportionality. Since Mr Kimblin rightly accepted that he could not say that the cumulative effect of other injunctions was something to which the judge should have paid no attention at all, the difference between the judge’s approach and Mr Kimblin’s ultimate position was nugatory. I therefore reject this fourth criticism of the judge’s proportionality exercise.  </p>

Thirdly, and most important of all, the Accommodation Assessment was prepared before the appellant had even thought about, let alone obtained, the wide interim injunction in this case.

This was in part because, on the arguments before her, it was said that this point only related to a quarter of the sites, but those sites could not be identified (see [70]). Furthermore, on the face of it, the existence of such permitted development rights would seem to require the appellant, as part of its application, at least to explain how or why they had been exhausted or did not apply. Finally, the criticism that the judge should have expressly preserved any permitted development rights in the injunction is most unfair, given that she expressly raised it and the offer was declined by the appellant’s junior counsel.  </p>

The travelling showman exception in the GPDO is perhaps a good example of this. The judge needed to be satisfied that the proposed injunction would not cut across that permitted development right, because the Accommodation Assessment showed that there were large numbers of travelling showmen in Bromley. The appellant did not demonstrate that to her (or my) satisfaction. This may be something which, in another case, could be resolved, either by way of the wording of the injunction, or by the designation of particular sites for this permitted development. But the judge was entitled to reach the view that she did on this issue, based on the evidence before her.

It is a striking feature of many of the documents that the court was shown that the absence of sufficient transit sites has repeatedly stymied any coherent attempt to deal with this issue.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, boroughwide injunctions are inherently problematic. They give the Gypsy and Traveller community no room for manoeuvre. They are much more likely to be refused by the court as a result (as happened here). The solution in <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton,</span> which identified particularly vulnerable sites but did not include all the sites owned by the council, seems to me to be a much more proportionate answer. I do not accept that this automatically means that the remaining sites will be the subject of unauthorised encampment, as Mr Kimblin suggested, but even if that happens, it is likely to be a better solution than a potentially discriminatory blanket ban. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The same is true of the duration of the injunction. Again, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton</span> case, the injunction was limited to a period of one year after which there was a review. That again seems to me to be sensible. I consider that it is - without more - potentially fatal to any application for a local authority to seek a combination of a boroughwide injunction and a duration of a period as long as five years.  </p>
