Her complaint, in essence, is that, in the course of those proceedings, the Firm negligently failed to obtain expert evidence as to the value of certain real properties and jewellery, and to secure permission to admit such evidence at the financial remedies hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The District Judge in the present action had found that Ms Holt’s claim against the Firm, so far as founded in contract, was time barred, after expiry of the 6 year limitation period, by virtue of s.5 of the Limitation Act 1980, but that her claim founded on tort was not so barred by the equivalent provision in s.2 of that Act. The Firm appealed against the District Judge’s order, in respect of his conclusion as to the claim in tort. Judge Ralton allowed that appeal. The judge found that Ms Holt’s claim as a whole, therefore, was barred by both s. 2 and s. 5 of the 1980 Act. As a result, he awarded summary judgment in favour of the Firm pursuant to CPR Part 24. The judge ordered Ms Holt to pay the costs of the action to be assessed. He directed that any further application for permission to appeal from his order should be made to this court. Permission to appeal was granted by Floyd LJ by his order of 14 January 2020 (sealed on 16.1.20). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Ms Holt retained the Firm to act for her in the financial relief proceedings, which had been initiated by the Husband on 15 February 2011. The first directions appointment (“FDA”) in those proceedings was held on 1 July 2011 and the financial dispute resolution (“FDR”) hearing took place on 11 October 2011. At the FDA, the court ordered valuation of the family home, and of some adjoining land, by a joint expert and that report was available at the FDR.  No directions were given for the valuation of some nine “buy-to-let” properties held by Ms Holt and the Husband in their separate names, although an order was made for provision of the completion statements for those properties. At the FDR, further orders were made for the Husband to provide evidence as to the existence and value of items of jewellery that he was claiming that Ms Holt had. No further orders for valuation evidence were sought by the Firm on Ms Holt’s behalf. Ms Holt claims in these proceedings that the Firm negligently failed to obtain expert evidence of the value of the investment properties and of her jewellery. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The final hearing of the financial relief proceedings was fixed, at or shortly after the FDR, for a date in mid-February 2012. On 19 January 2012, a solicitor at the Firm wrote to a firm of estate agents asking them to provide up-date valuations of the “buyto-let” properties in Ms Holt’s name on a “drive-by” basis, saying that “… the previous values we have given to the court were estimates by [Ms Holt] herself”. The agents produced such a valuation on 24 January 2012 and a copy was sent to the Husband’s solicitors on 10 February 2012, asking them to agree that the valuation should be admitted in evidence in the proceedings. This new material set the value of Ms Holt’s investment properties at £84,500. The Husband’s solicitors responded that the values of the properties had been agreed at the FDA and it was impermissible to seek to adduce new, unilateral valuations a matter of days before the hearing. It seems that the matter was not taken further by the Firm by way of application to the court to admit the additional evidence. </p>

The jewellery was taken to be worth £50,000. (District Judge Watkins recorded District Judge Daniel’s finding that Ms Holt was “… not being straightforward about the extent and values of jewellery in her possession”.) Total net matrimonial assets, after deduction of a joint overdraft, were found to be worth £483,000.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">District Judge Daniel decided to increase Ms Holt’s capital share, from the starting point of equality, to achieve a “clean break” solution in the case, with an absence of any continuing maintenance obligation on the Husband’s part, and having regard to Ms Holt’s past and future care of the three minor children and her inferior pension provision. He awarded Ms Holt 60% of the net (non-pension) assets, leaving her with approximately £290,000. To implement this, he directed the joint debts to be left with the Husband and ordered him to pay a lump sum of £13,000 to Ms Holt. </p>

The letter concluded by asserting that limitation in respect of the claim might expire on 10 April 2012 (i.e. 6 years from the date of the circulation of District Judge Daniel’s draft judgment) and proposed a “standstill agreement”. In their response (on 28 June 2018), the Firm’s solicitors asserted that the latest date for limitation purposes was 16 March 2012 (i.e. the last day of the financial relief hearing).

Until that time, it was argued, any party could have applied to the court in the divorce proceedings to adduce further evidence, including the valuation evidence in question. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Moore’s starting point was that the financial relief proceedings in divorce were a very particular type of litigation which cannot be compared with other types of civil proceedings. He emphasised the wide discretion of the court in seeking to achieve a fair distribution of assets between ex-spouses and financial relief generally upon divorce. Such decisions are not clear-cut statements of entitlement to damages, but an exercise of discretion to produce a fair result: before the decision the divorcing spouse has no “right” which can be valued. To an extent, Mr Moore argued, such proceedings are inquisitorial, and the family judge is not necessarily as confined, as in other civil actions, by the parties’ approach to what evidence is material and what is not. As to the particular characteristics of financial relief proceedings in general, he referred us to the judgment of Lord Wilson of Culworth in the Supreme Court (with whom the other members of the court agreed) in <span style="font-style:italic">Wyatt v Vince (Nos. 1 and 2)</span> [2015] 1 WLR 1228, 1241 at [27]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The result of this, Mr Moore argued, was that whatever the nature of the evidence adduced, the court had a very wide discretion and could call for any evidence it wished. The outcome of the case was, therefore, contingent upon the judgment at the end of the day. In the present case, the failure to adduce the expert evidence, which is criticised in the present proceedings, might have made no difference in the end, depending entirely on the solution adopted by the judge in the division of the matrimonial assets.

The valuer is liable for the adverse consequences, flowing from entering into the transaction, which are attributable to the deficiency in the valuation. This principle of liability, easier to formulate than to apply, has next to be translated into practical terms. As to this, the basic comparison remains in point, as the means of identifying whether the lender has suffered any loss in consequence of entering into the transaction. If he has not, then currently he has no cause of action against the valuer. The deficiency in security has, in practice, caused him no damage.

That is said (in para. 15) to have caused the Husband to have cogent objection to the later admission of the “drive-by” valuations and, therefore in the end, to the lack of consideration of any such evidence by the District Judge in deciding the case. It is then specifically pleaded (in para. 31) what values the District Judge would have had before him if the additional evidence had been obtained. That would have required (as alleged in para. 32) the judge to direct a balancing payment of slightly more than £89,000 (instead of £13,000 as ordered) in Ms Holt’s favour to make a 60/40 split between the spouses. In a further table (in para. 33), the actual difference in result achieved, owing to the alleged negligence, is said to have been £76,038. As Mr Fowler submitted the pleaded claim argues that the failure to procure the admission of the late valuation material for the properties, and the “over- valuation” of the jewellery, led inexorably to the result identified.  </p>

At that stage, Ms Holt had lost the opportunity to invite the judge to assess her case based on what she asserted were the proper values of the properties and the jewellery. On that hypothesis, she had lost a chance of arguing her case for a better outcome on fuller evidence. “Loss of a chance” was one of the “…illustrations of a kind of loss which is meant by actual damage …” described by Stephenson LJ in the passage of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Forster v Outred &amp; Co.</span> (supra) which was approved by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Nykredit</span>.

It is always on the basis of the evidence leading to the computation that the final distribution decision is made. One can agree with Mr Moore that there may be more than one way in which a judge may achieve the final distribution of matrimonial assets on divorce, but the building blocks of that eventual distribution are set when the values of the parties’ assets are computed.

The value of her position is said to have been somewhere in the region of £90,000 worse than it would have been if she had had a properly arguable case that her property values were as she asserted them to be. </p>

Between 1989 and 1995, a partner in the defendants’ firm had signed reports certifying that the solicitor had complied with the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules. The partner had failed to make a proper examination of the relevant documents and failed to notice that the solicitor had misappropriated some £750,000 of clients’ money in the period between 1990 and 1996. The Law Society intervened in the practice and the solicitor was struck off the roll. In July 1996 a former client of the solicitor made a claim for compensation from the Solicitors Compensation Fund and over the ensuing years the Law Society made payments out of the fund to clients who had lost out through the misappropriations.  </p>

At a preliminary hearing, a judge held that the Society’s cause of action had accrued as soon as the solicitor misappropriated money, thereby exposing the Society to the risk of a claim on the fund. The Court of Appeal reversed that decision and the accountants’ appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed. It was held that the misappropriations gave rise to a possible liability to pay a grant out of the fund, contingent upon the misappropriations not being otherwise made good and upon a claim in proper form being made. Such a liability would be enforceable in public law and would count as “damage” for the purposes of determining the date of accrual of a cause of action. However, it was held that a contingent liability, such as the possibility of an obligation to make a future payment, was not damage until the contingency occurred. Thus, there was no loss or damage until a claim upon the fund was made and no cause of action had accrued until then. The claim was not statute barred. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In my judgment, to make a distinction between matrimonial finance proceedings and other forms of civil litigation on the technical basis that one claim is assignable and the other is not would be a triumph of technicality over reality. The object of the law is to compensate for damage caused by the loss or diminution of valuable rights by professional negligence. The valuable rights of a spouse on divorce should be subject to the same rules in this context as other such rights and should not be the subject of artificial technical distinctions, serving no useful purpose. It is here that I believe that the policy consideration identified by Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Nykredit</span>, and cited to us by Mr Fowler, can properly come into play. At 1633C-D of the report of his speech in that case, Lord Nicholls said:</p>

The amount of a plaintiff's loss frequently becomes clearer after court proceedings have been started and while awaiting trial. This is an everyday experience. There is no reason to think that the approach I have spelled out will give rise to any insuperable difficulties in practice. In their practical conduct of litigation courts are well able to ensure that assessments of damages are made in a sensible way. It is not necessary, in order to achieve a sensible and fair result, to go so far as asserting that the plaintiff has no cause of action, and hence may not issue a writ, until the assessment can be made with the degree of precision that accompanies a realisation of the security. Further, within the bounds of sense and reasonableness the policy of the law should be to advance, rather than retard, the accrual of a cause of action. This is especially so if the law provides parallel causes of action in contract and in tort in respect of the same conduct. The disparity between the time when these parallel causes of action arise should be smaller, rather than greater.” </p>

That is not to say that it does not have value at the outset or until judgment or settlement. It does not mean either that that value cannot be damaged by negligent conduct of the litigation in the period up to judgment.  </p>

I do not see this point negated, the circumstances of the present case, by Lord Mance’s disinclination to adopt the same policy point in <span style="font-style:italic">Sephton</span> at [80]. Divorce litigation in the present context is no different from other litigation. A client’s rights can be sensibly evaluated, and can be damaged by negligence, at almost any stage of the proceedings; their lack of assignability, to my mind, is by the way. </p>

That was a case of alleged professional negligence in the conduct of a personal injury claim. The claimant had been injured in a car accident on 20 April 1999. Negligence on the part of one “L” was admitted. In May 1999, she instructed the defendant solicitors. Proceedings were issue on 12 April 2002, with the limitation period due to expire on 20 April. However, they were mistakenly admitted against L’s husband. On 8 August 2002 proceedings were issued against L and no point was taken about limitation. Particulars of Claim were due to be served on 11 August but were not served. The claim at that stage was limited to £50,000. There followed extensive delay while there were discussions about medical experts. In June 2004, counsel advised the claimant that the action was vulnerable to strike out, but the defendant’s solicitors gave express assurances that they would not take procedural points about the delay. On 25 January </p>

On 1 November 2005, the claim was settled for £25,000, plus costs. The settlement was finalised by court order on 6 February 2006.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">On 10 January 2011, the claimant instituted proceedings against her first solicitors for damages for negligence. The claim form stated that damages “not exceeding £250,000” were sought. On 21 February 2011, the defendant solicitors applied for summary judgment because (among other reasons) the claim was statute barred. They argued that damage had been suffered at the latest on 2 June 2004, when counsel had advised that the original claim had become liable to be struck out for delay. The application succeeded in the County Court, but an appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed (on 5 June 2013). It was held by the majority of the court (Moses and Rimer LJJ) that actual damage only arose after 25 January 2005 when the solicitors acting for the defendant in the original action withdrew their agreement to any further delay in filing of the Particulars of Claim. Therefore, proceedings issued on 10 January 2011 were within the six-year limitation period. <authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription"> In the end Ms Berney’s claim was dismissed by the High Court. The trial judge found that she had suffered no loss in fact because the sum of £25,000 was not a sum which she could have bettered in the light of the medical reports she held. Permission to appeal to this court was refused on the papers by Gloster LJ and was also refused on a renewed oral application for permission on 9 November 2016 by Longmore LJ: see [2016] EWCA Civ 1190. </p>

However, in a case like the present the reality is that the expert evidence of values upon which a party may rely, and upon which proceedings will be resolved, will be settled well prior to the date of the hearing. If one party, owing to a solicitor’s negligence, loses the opportunity to adduce the expert evidence that puts his/her case in the best possible light then the value of that party’s claim is inevitably diminished.
