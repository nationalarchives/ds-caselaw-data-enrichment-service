	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claimants are the long leasehold owners of four flats in a striking modern development designed by Richard Rogers and Partners (subsequently, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners), comprising four blocks of flats known as Neo Bankside, on the south bank of the River Thames. The design, planning process and construction of the development took place between 2006 and September 2012. The claimants’ flats are in Block C of Neo Bankside, and they are directly opposite a new extension of the Tate Modern called the Blavatnik Building. The Blavatnik Building includes the viewing gallery, which runs around all four sides of the top floor, Level 10, and allows visitors to the Tate Modern to enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of central London.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The flats which are the subject of the claim are 1301, 1801, 1901, and 2101. The first two digits indicate the floor on which the flat is situated. The floor plans of each flat in Block C vary but each flat involved in this action comprises two parts: a general living space, and a triangular end piece known as a “winter garden”. The winter gardens have floor-to-ceiling single-glazed windows, which are separated from the flat by double-glazed glass doors. They have the same heated flooring as the rest of the accommodation but are separated from the rest of the accommodation by a lip and the double-glazed doors. Although the winter gardens were initially conceived by the developers as a type of indoor balcony, in the case of all the claimants’ flats the winter garden has become part of the general living accommodation. The other sides of the flats which enclose the living space of the accommodation, including the kitchen, dining, and sitting areas, are made up of floor-to-ceiling clear glass panels but equipped with wooden fascias which prevent a whole view of the interior of the dining and sitting areas.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Adjacent to Neo Bankside is the Tate Modern (which, as well as the defendants, we shall call “the Tate”). The Tate is free and open to the public. Between 2006 and 2016 the Tate designed, obtained planning permission for and built an extension known as the Blavatnik Building. One of the features of the Blavatnik Building is the viewing gallery. The viewing gallery provides a striking view of London to the north, west, and east, with a less interesting view to the south. The viewing gallery has been open to the public since the Blavatnik Building was completed in 2016. The viewing gallery attracts hundreds of thousands of people a year (with one estimate at 500,000 – 600,000), with a maximum of 300 visitors at one time. Visitors spend 15 minutes on average in the viewing gallery. Originally, the viewing gallery was open when the museum was open: 10am – 6pm Sunday to Thursday and 10am to 10pm on Friday and Saturday. On 26 April 2018 the opening hours for the viewing gallery changed. It is now closed to public access at 5.30pm on Sunday to Thursday, and on Friday and Saturday the south and west sides are closed from 7pm and the north and east sides are closed from 10pm. There is a monthly event called Tate Lates, which currently takes place on the last Friday of each month, and for which the viewing gallery, other than the south side, remains open until 10pm. The viewing gallery also hosts financially lucrative commercial and internal events for the Tate. In its first 17 months 52 external events were hosted there.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The winter gardens of Block C are roughly parallel to the Blavatnik Building. The distance between the viewing gallery and the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> floor flat in Block C is just over 34m. Absent a barrier, visitors to the viewing gallery can see straight into the living accommodation of the claimants’ flats. The most extensive view is of the interior of flats 1801 and 1901, with less for flat 2101, and less again for flat 1301. The flats have been fitted with solar blinds which, when kept down, obscure the view of the interior of the flat from the outside during the day. In the evening, however, when the lights are on, shadows of occupants may be visible to onlookers. The solar blinds also obscure the views of the outside and deprive the occupants of their use of the windows on one side of their flat.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Visitors in the viewing gallery frequently look into the claimants’ flats and take photographs, and less frequently view the claimants and their flats with binoculars. Photographs of the flats are posted on social media by visitors. On the platform Instagram there were 124 posts in the period between June 2016 and April 2018. It has been estimated that those posts reached an audience of 38,600. The Tate took two steps to attempt to address the problem: it posted a notice on the southern gallery asking visitors to respect the privacy of the Tate’s neighbours and it instructed security guards to stop photography.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The designs for the Blavatnik Building always included a viewing gallery in some form; although its precise extent varied through successive iterations of the design. There is no planning document which indicates that overlooking by the viewing gallery in the direction of Block C was considered by the local planning authority at any stage. It is not likely that the planning authority considered the extent of overlooking. Further, while the Neo Bankside developer was aware of the plans for a viewing gallery, they did not foresee the level of intrusion which resulted. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The claim form in these proceedings was issued on 22 February 2017 claiming, as we have said, an injunction requiring the Tate to prevent members of the public or any other licensees from observing the claimants’ flats from the part of the viewing gallery shown cross-hatched on the plan attached to the particulars of claim. By time of the trial the cross-hatching had been amended to cover the whole of the southern walkway, fronting directly on the flats, and also the southern half of the western walkway. The particulars of claim alleged that the use of that part of the viewing gallery unreasonably interfered with the claimants’ enjoyment of their flats so as to be a nuisance. The particulars of claim also alleged that the use of that part of the viewing gallery infringed the claimants’ exercise of their rights, conferred by Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), to respect for their private and family lives and their homes, and that therefore the Tate, as a public authority, was in breach of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the HRA 1998”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In its defence the Tate denied that its use of the viewing gallery unreasonably interfered with the claimants’ ordinary enjoyment of their flats. It denied that the viewing gallery diminished the utility of the claimants’ land or caused injury to their land. The Tate denied that it was a public authority for the purposes of the HRA 1998, and, insofar as it was a hybrid public authority for the purposes of that Act, the Tate alleged that its use of the relevant part of the viewing gallery was a private act. The Tate denied that it was in breach of section 6 of the HRA 1998. It denied that the claimants were victims of a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. It denied that its use of the relevant part of the viewing gallery interfered with the claimants’ right to respect for their private and family lives and their homes. It alleged that, if there was any interference with such rights, such interference was justified under Article 8.2. The Tate alleged that it had taken all reasonable steps to ensure that its visitors did not cause any disturbance to its neighbours, including the claimants. The Tate denied that the claimants’ legal rights had in any way been interfered with or breached by it, and that in the circumstances the claimants were entitled to the injunction sought or to any relief. <span style="font-weight:bold">The trial </span></p>

If material interference is established, the question of whether the defendant can defeat the claim by showing that the use of their land is a reasonable use was answered by <span style="font-style:italic">Bamford v Turnley </span>(1862) 3 B&amp;S 66. In that case the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was liable for nuisance for burning bricks in kilns on the defendant’s land which resulted in a bad smell affecting the comfortable and healthy occupation of the plaintiff’s land. The jury found for the defendant. What was at issue on appeal in the Exchequer Chamber was whether the Chief Justice had misdirected the jury when he told them that they were to find for the defendant if they were of the opinion that the spot where the bricks were burned was a proper and convenient spot and the burning of them was, under the circumstances, a reasonable use by the defendant of his own land. It was held on appeal that there had been a misdirection.

Its meaning is coloured by association with “the common and ordinary use and occupation of land and houses”. “Conveniently” means that the act must be done in a way that is reasonable, having regard to the neighbour’s interests. By way of illustration of both points, in <span style="font-style:italic">Southwark</span> (at p.16) Lord Hoffmann, commenting on Bramwell B’s comments quoted above, said that it may be reasonable to have appliances such as a television or washing machine in one’s flat but unreasonable to put them hard up against a party wall so that noise and vibrations are unnecessarily transmitted to the neighbour’s premises. </p>

He went on to explain, however, that the law gives effect to those broad concepts by the principle stated by Bramwell B in the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Bamford </span>quoted above.

The plaintiff’s property adjoined the defendants’ property. The plaintiff replaced the frames of the ancient lights, which had, in part, been painted white and, in part, been fitted with small leaden lattices, with plate glass, which allowed much more light and air. The defendants objected and began to erect a wooden framework in the yard that abutted both properties within a few inches of the plaintiff’s ancient lights. The plaintiff brought proceedings for an injunction for, among other things, removal of the wooden framework. The defendants contended that the increase in the amount of light was a new easement, and the defendants were entitled to reduce the light to its original amount. They also argued that there was interference with the privacy of the defendants, for which the court would grant relief. Kindersley V-C refused to grant an injunction. He held, on the first argument, that a mere increase in light through the same aperture did not give rise to a new easement. On the privacy argument, he said the following (at p.803): </p>

The House of Lords, upholding the decision of the lower courts, held that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for interference with his ancient lights. The speeches in the House of Lords considered generally the law relating to the opening of windows overlooking another property. They made clear that there was no cause of action for overlooking, however many new windows there might be, and that the only remedy of the adjoining owner was (in the case of windows which were not ancient windows) to build upon the adjoining land itself so as to obstruct the light to and the views from the new windows. </p>

The staircase was erected by another defendant, Mrs Lightbody, who was the tenant of another flat comprising rooms on the ground, first and second floors of the building, and who wished to subdivide her flat into two smaller flats and to provide a means of access to one of those smaller flats on the first floor. A person accessing the staircase would have a direct view into the plaintiffs’ bedroom. The plaintiffs relied on the terms of covenants in Mrs Lightbody’s lease not to do anything in her flat causing a nuisance to neighbouring premises; upon the principle of non-derogation from grant, that is to say that no one can be allowed to derogate from his or her own grant; and upon a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment in the plaintiff’s lease. </p>

The plaintiff claimed that the broadcasting had caused large numbers of people, who would otherwise have attended the race meetings, not to do so but instead to listen to the broadcasts, as a result of which the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage. He sought injunctions against the defendants on the ground of, among other things, common law nuisance. The majority (Latham CJ, Dixon J and McTiernan J) held that the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales dismissing the claim should be affirmed. A narrow reading of the judgments of the majority is that the defendants had not interfered with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff’s land, but rather the effect of their actions was to make the business carried on by the plaintiff less profitable.

It is quite different from just overlooking and what takes place on the Tate’s viewing gallery. Moreover, as the Judge noted in the present case (at [146]), Young J in <span style="font-style:italic">Raciti</span> regarded the application for the interlocutory injunction before him as “virtually the hearing of a demurrer” and so it was only necessary for the plaintiff to establish that there was an arguable cause of action. </p>

The absence at common law of a right to light, short of an easement after 20 years’ use which satisfies the relevant conditions, and of general air flow and prospect, are mirrored by the absence of a right to prevent looking into a residence. The reason for the former (no general right to light, air flow and prospect) has been judicially explained as being that such a right would constrain building in towns and cities.  </p>

In that case the House of Lords confirmed the decision of the lower courts that the claimants had no claim in nuisance against the defendants who had constructed a very tall and large building which allegedly interfered with the reception of television broadcasts in the plaintiffs’ homes. There was no cause of action because of the general principle that at common law anyone may build whatever they like upon their land. Lord Lloyd described (at p.699D) such a situation as “<span style="font-style:italic">damnum absque injuria</span>”: a loss which the house-owner has undoubtedly suffered but which gives rise to no infringement of their legal rights. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.00in">Unlike such annoyances as noise, dirt, fumes, noxious smells and vibrations emanating from neighbouring land, it would be difficult, in the case of overlooking, to apply the objective test in nuisance for determining whether there has been a material interference with the amenity value of the affected land. While the viewing of the claimants’ land by thousands of people from the Tate’s viewing gallery may be thought to be a clear case of nuisance at one end of the spectrum, overlooking on a much smaller scale may be just as objectively annoying to owners and occupiers of overlooked properties. The construction of a balcony overlooking a neighbour’s garden which results in a complete or substantial lack of privacy for all or part of the garden, with particular significance in the summer months, and which may even diminish the marketability or value of the overlooked property, would appear to satisfy the objective test. There would also be a question whether, in such a case, it makes any difference if there was more than one balcony or more than one family using the balcony or balconies. It is difficult to envisage any clear legal guidance as to where the line would be drawn between what is legal and what is not, depending on the number of people and frequency of overlooking. It is well known that overlooking is frequently a ground of objection to planning applications: any recognition that the cause of action in nuisance includes overlooking raises the prospect of claims in nuisance when such a planning objection has been rejected.  </p>

Lord Hoffmann said in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter</span> (at p.710E), in which the appellate committee was asked to develop the common law by creating a new right of action against an owner who erects a building upon his land, it was relevant to take into account the existence of other methods by which the interests of the locality could be protected.

The power of the planning authority to grant or refuse permission, subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, provides a mechanism for control of the unrestricted right to build which can be used for the protection of people living in the vicinity of a development. In a case such as this, where the development is likely to have an impact upon many people over a large area, the planning system is, I think, is a far more appropriate form of control, from the point of view of both the developer and the public, than enlarging the right to bring actions for nuisance at common law. It enables the issues to be debated before an expert forum at a planning inquiry and gives the developer the advantage of certainty as to what he is entitled to build. </p>

There are already other laws which bear on privacy, including the law relating to confidentiality, misuse of private information, data protection (Data Protection Act 2018), harassment and stalking (Protection Harassment Act 1997). This is an area in which the legislature has intervened and is better suited than the courts to weigh up competing interests: cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Wainwright v Home Office</span> [2003] UKHL 53, [2004] 2 AC 406, esp. at [33], in which the House of Lords held that there is no common law tort of invasion of privacy and that it is an area which requires a detailed approach which can be achieved only by legislation rather than the broad brush of common law principle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Firstly, the Judge said (at [205]) that the developers in building the flats, and the claimants as a successors in title who chose to buy the flats, had “created or submitted themselves to a sensitivity to privacy which is greater than would the case of a less glassed design”; and that “[i]t would be wrong to allow this self-induced incentive to gaze, and to infringe privacy, and self-induced exposure to the outside world, to create a liability nuisance”. It was in that connection that he considered (at [201]-[202]) the counter-factual of a building with significant vertical and perhaps horizontal breaks to interrupt the inward view. He drew an analogy (at [204]-[205] and [211]) with nuisance cases which have established that doing something is not a nuisance if it adversely affects a particularly sensitive process or trade in an adjoining property but would not have affected any ordinary process or trade: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson v Kilvert</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">In the present case we are not concerned with any undue sensitivity of the claimants as individuals or what is being carried on in the flats which would fall foul of the objective reasonable user test for nuisance. In the context of the tort of nuisance, what is in issue is the impact of the viewing gallery on the amenity value of flats themselves. There being no finding by the Judge that the viewing gallery is “necessary” for the common and ordinary use and occupation of the Tate within Bramwell B’s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Bamford</span> quoted above, once it is established that the use of the viewing balcony has caused material damage to the amenity value of the claimants’ flats and that the use of the flats is ordinary and reasonable, having regard to the locality, there would be a liability in nuisance if (contrary to our decision) the cause of action extended to overlooking. There would be no question in those circumstances of any particular sensitivity of the flats, nor of any need on the part of the claimants to take what the Judge described (in [214]) as “remedial steps”: <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Jackson</span> [1977] 1 QB 966 (a claim for nuisance from cricket balls from the neighbouring cricket ground damaging the plaintiffs’ house held not defeated by the plaintiffs’ refusal of the defendants’ offers to provide protective measures). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, and connected to the Judge’s approach to the issues of sensitivity and protective measures, the Judge conducted an overall assessment of the reasonableness of the claimants, on the one hand, and the Tate, on the other hand, in the light of all the circumstances. He said (at [180]), for example: </p>

However, privacy is a bit different.  Susceptibilities and tastes differ, and in recognition of the fact that privacy might sometimes require to be enhanced it has become acceptable to expect those wishing to enhance it to protect their own interests.  I refer, for example, to net curtains.   In the present case, if the occupiers find matters too intrusive they can take at least one of the measures referred to above.  It will, of course, detract from their living conditions, but not to an unacceptable degree.  Looking at the overall balance which has to be achieved, the availability and reasonableness of such measures is another reason why I consider there to be no nuisance in this case.” </p>

We consider that the Judge’s balancing exercise, assessing what would be reasonable as between the claimants and the Tate, including protective measures which it would be open to the claimants to take to reduce the intrusion of privacy into their homes from the viewing gallery, is, for the reasons we have given above, contrary to the general principles of private nuisance. </p>
