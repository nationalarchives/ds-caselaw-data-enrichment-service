Nor have HMRC pursued powers contained in schedule 36 Finance Act 2008 (“FA 2008”) to obtain information and/or documents from the appellants. In those circumstances, the appellants challenged the lawfulness of the ongoing investigation by judicial review, contending, among other things, that HMRC had (and have) no power to conduct it so that it has no lawful basis, and further, it is irrational and disproportionate. The appellants invited the court to quash the investigation, order return of material obtained in the course of the investigation (as “fruits of the poisoned tree”), and require HMRC to notify third parties that any documentation/information previously requested pursuant to it is no longer required. </p>

He says he pays substantial sums of tax and is willing to pay all that is legally due; that he has always sought professional advice to ensure that his tax affairs are in order; but that he now feels hounded by HMRC to the extent that he is considering "relocating to Spain or actually moving to an 'offshore' jurisdiction".

There was therefore a 12-month window running from the day after which each tax return was delivered in which HMRC could open an enquiry (“as of right”) into the return under section 9A TMA 1970. The appellants submitted that once that period had expired the only statutory mechanism available to HMRC to carry out an investigation is by use of the information powers in schedule 36 FA 2008, with their inbuilt safeguards. That might (or might not, depending on time limits and other conditions applicable) lead to a discovery assessment under section 29 TMA 1970. However the appellants contended that HMRC are not entitled to conduct a lengthy, wide-ranging investigation, into a personal tax return, outside the terms of section 9A TMA 1970 and schedule 36 FA 2008, and backed-up by sanctions.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">5(1) CRCA 2005 and section 1 TMA 1970, HMRC’s functions include the collection of taxes (and so far as reasonably possible, collecting the correct amount of tax from taxpayers). Conducting an investigation into whether a taxpayer has declared all his income and paid the correct amount of tax is necessary, expedient, incidental or conducive to the exercise of that function and is authorised by the powers in section 9 CRCA 2005.  The use of such an “informal investigation” (as the judge termed it) was not inconsistent with the statutory scheme, but was consistent with it. The statutory scheme includes not only opening an enquiry into a return under section 9A TMA 1970 during the enquiry window, but also checking returns without opening a section 9A enquiry, including after the enquiry window has closed, with a view to ascertaining if there is ground to issue a discovery assessment, and that such checking can include not just rereading the file but carrying out investigations and enquiries to see if any further information can be obtained that sheds light on the question. Given that statutory scheme, there is nothing inconsistent in HMRC having power to ask a taxpayer for information and documents on a voluntary basis. Moreover, it would be the very antithesis of good administration for an arm of the state to use compulsory powers as a first step in obtaining information from an individual, rather than resort to them only when all attempts to obtain the information voluntarily had run into the sand. As a matter of common sense, cooperation and collaboration facilitates the collection of the public revenue. </p>

In oral argument before the judge, Mr Moser accepted that the argument that the investigation was irrational and/or disproportionate amounted to a submission that HMRC should give adequate and intelligible reasons for their investigation: the appellants submitted that HMRC had not stated with appropriate particularity, the scope of their investigation and the basis upon which it was said there were reasonable grounds to justify each part of that investigation. Mr Robertson was in the position of “<span style="font-style:italic">not knowing what is being investigated, why it is being investigated and when there might be closure of the investigation</span>”. Further, if HMRC did not have sufficient reasons to start an investigation, then the investigation was unlawful at the outset and it was no answer for them to say they were no longer relying on the same matters to justify continuing the investigation; once unlawful it remained unlawful and HMRC could not justify it by reference to any information they had discovered as these would be “fruits of the poisoned tree”.</p>

The judge rejected this contention. Having traced the course of the investigation, from the admittedly very widely worded letter of 9 June 2016 to the meetings and correspondence that followed, and then to the witness statements ultimately served in the judicial review proceedings (which included Mr Brown’s statement listing outstanding concerns he had in relation to Mr Robertson’s tax position and explaining why he had those concerns), he held that Mr Robertson and his advisers knew the gist of HMRC’s concerns and were not entitled to further explanation of the basis of these concerns. The concerns were not on the face of it irrational or misconceived. He found it had not been established that HMRC’s actions in deciding to carry out the investigation, or in continuing it, involved any breach of public law. In those circumstances it was not for the court by judicial review, to micromanage HMRC’s conduct of the continuing investigation. </p>

First he accepts that HMRC have power to conduct informal investigations internally; for example, they can look at their files and any documents held on file to check a taxpayer’s position. Secondly, he accepts they can contact the taxpayer to seek voluntary assistance by asking questions of the taxpayer, subject to two conditions, namely that HMRC must give reasons for such an informal investigation (identifying their specific concerns and explaining why); and any such informal investigation must be and be seen to be entirely voluntary.

The wider statutory scheme envisages that within the enquiry window, HMRC may conduct a section 9A enquiry “as of right” (in other words, without any reason to suspect inaccuracies in the return), but outside the enquiry window (indeed, outside the section 9A procedure), HMRC does not have the ability to conduct an “as of right” investigation. Rather an investigation can only be commenced if there is a (rational) reason to suspect that tax has gone unpaid (which, as he submits, HMRC appeared to concede below) and by use of compulsory powers in schedule 36.  He claims support for this contention in section 9A TMA 1970, because if an “as of right” (informal) investigation is permissible at any time, the time limit provision in section 9A(1)(2) TMA 1970 is rendered meaningless; and the fact that where an enquiry is opened under section 9A TMA 1970, the taxpayer can apply to the FTT for a closure notice pursuant to section 28A TMA 1970 (another safeguard that would be avoided). </p>

That involves both a power and a duty to collect tax. The well-established principle of tax law to the effect that there is a public interest in taxpayers paying the correct amount of tax means that the duty to collect tax is to collect, so far as reasonably possible, the correct amount of tax rather than simply the tax that a taxpayer accepts is due (see if necessary, <span style="font-style:italic">Tower M Cashback LLP1 v HMRC</span> [2017] UKSC 19 (Lord Walker at [15])). </p>

The position is all the more clear because the ancillary powers conferred on HMRC by section 9(1) CRCA 2005 are to do anything which “<span style="font-style:italic">they think”</span> necessary, expedient, incidental or conducive to (or in) the exercise of their functions. As the judge said, the question therefore is not strictly whether carrying out an informal investigation is ancillary to another power (or function) but whether it is thought by HMRC to be necessary, expedient, incidental or conducive to that function. Given the wide managerial discretion available to HMRC as to the best means of collecting tax, it cannot possibly be said that it is impermissible or unreasonable for HMRC to hold the view that it is both expedient and conducive to their tax collecting function to conduct informal investigations. </p>

Outside the scope of a section 9A enquiry, the statutory scheme confers power by section 29 TMA 1970, on HMRC to collect tax by way of a discovery assessment where HMRC “discover” that there has been a loss of tax consequent on an assessment to tax being insufficient or relief given having become excessive. The power to make a discovery assessment applies outside the section 9A enquiry window in circumstances where there is no such window because </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Since it is part of the statutory scheme that HMRC can issue discovery assessments where the relevant conditions are fulfilled, it is necessarily part of HMRC’s functions to consider and investigate whether a discovery assessment should be made. As Ms Nathan QC submits the potential for a discovery assessment may be triggered in various ways. For example, knowledge gleaned from a later tax return submitted by a taxpayer may reveal the absence of an earlier return, or the possibility of an insufficiency in an earlier period; information from a third party source may lead to this possibility; and there may be situations where HMRC receive information which, while not revealing an insufficiency of tax, gives cause to investigate whether there is an insufficiency of tax in relation to a particular taxpayer or taxpayers. Investigation is necessarily required to convert a suspicion into an awareness of an insufficiency. </p>

Comparison of the terms of paragraph 21(6) and section 29 TMA demonstrates that the three alternative suspicions in paragraph 21 that must be satisfied are the same three discoveries that enable a discovery assessment to be made.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Schedule 36 is not drafted so as to confer power on HMRC to check tax returns by way of conducting investigations or enquiries. Paragraphs 1(1) and 2(1) of schedule 36 make clear, they are not the source of that power: they proceed on the basis that HMRC have power (conferred elsewhere) to check the tax position of the taxpayer, in other words to carry out “an investigation or enquiry of any kind” (see schedule 36, paragraph 58). Schedule 36 confers power to obtain information and documents by compulsion for that purpose. Since the statutory scheme contemplates checks otherwise than pursuant to section 9A, there is nothing inconsistent in HMRC asking a taxpayer for information and documents on a voluntary basis (without compulsion) where they think it necessary or expedient in the exercise of their function of checking a taxpayer’s tax position, or incidental or conducive to the exercise of that function. </p>

The principled position is that all investigations are subject to the public law restriction that powers must only be exercised for a proper purpose. In the same way as a section 9A enquiry could not be launched purely out of malice or on a capricious basis, there is no reason for importing a test from paragraph 21 of schedule 36, which is concerned with powers of compulsion to provide information, to all other aspects of the exercise of functions by HMRC save (on the appellants’ case) section 9A enquiries. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">True it is, as Mr Moser submits, that paragraph 21 precludes the giving of information notices outside a section 9A enquiry unless the HMRC officer “has reason to suspect” under-assessment of income, capital gains or corporation tax.  But this is simply an additional statutory requirement for the exercise of this particular power of compulsion backed by penal sanctions. It does not import a statutory threshold for seeking the voluntary provision of information or documents. Nor does it preclude an informal investigation commenced by a letter in standard terms (as it is accepted the letter of 9 June 2016 was) seeking cooperation by the voluntary provision of information and documents in relation to a taxpayer’s tax position. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.00in">Contrary to the submissions of Mr Moser, an informal investigation, such as the one conducted here, is premised upon consent and cooperation. That was expressly stated in the 9 June letter and is not undermined by the letter’s reference to the fact that full cooperation would ensure penalties are reduced to their minimum levels and might avoid publication of the taxpayer’s details. As Ms Nathan submits, the letter quite properly refers to the possibility that the information held by HMRC that the taxpayer’s returns and accounts may be incorrect, may itself be incorrect or capable of a satisfactory explanation. No assumption is made. Secondly, it refers to the aim of the investigation if founded, namely a financial settlement of the unpaid tax together with any interest and penalties arising. The function of penalties here is very different to that served by the penalty provisions in schedule 36 FA 2008, which are directly linked to non-compliance with the information notice itself. Here, the penalty is linked to the under-stated tax if proved, with the penalty applied as a percentage of the under-paid tax. The detailed statutory provisions (contained in schedule 24 of Finance Act 2007) provide for a discount to be applied to the penalty assessed to reflect a taxpayer’s cooperation (see paragraph 10 of schedule 24). Likewise, there are statutory provisions (section 94 Finance Act 2009) dealing with publication of a taxpayer’s details following a deliberate under-declaration of tax. In these ways, cooperation and compliance are incentivised, but that does not convert an otherwise voluntary investigation into a compulsory one. The voluntary nature of the exercise means that the taxpayer can (at any time) simply refuse to cooperate or to continue cooperating and can thereby force HMRC to open a section 9A enquiry if the window remains open, or issue a formal information notice pursuant to schedule 36, with the attendant safeguards. </p>

Section 1 TMA 1970 gives HMRC what Lord Diplock described in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, Ex p National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd</span> [1982] AC 617 at 636 as: </p>

He submits that the criminal context in those cases was different; here we are concerned with a civil enquiry being conducted under the normal administrative powers of a public body.

	    <p style="margin-left:1.19in;margin-right:1.00in">“Ms Nathan did not suggest that HMRC could or did open informal investigations without any basis for them at all (unlike the case of a s.9A enquiry where I have accepted that HMRC do not need to have any suspicions before opening an enquiry). She took specific instructions on the basis of which she told me that HMRC investigate where they have a concern; that may be as a result of information received; or it may arise in some other way. She accepted that if an investigation is started without a proper purpose, it may be susceptible to judicial review. But she said there was nothing exceptional about the present case which justify judicial review. I accept the submissions. <span style="font-style:italic">Haworth</span> is not in my judgment of any direct assistance in the present case, and it is not necessary for HMRC to have any particular degree of confidence in the outcome before opening an informal investigation.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Mr Moser submits that this is an acceptance that HMRC must have reason to suspect underpayment of tax for it to be rational to investigate. It follows that it is incumbent on HMRC to demonstrate a rational basis for suspecting that a taxpayer’s return is inaccurate before commencing an informal investigation and in order to justify it. However, HMRC refused to explain what led them to suspect that Mr Robertson’s tax returns were inaccurate, and they therefore refused to explain the basis for commencing the informal investigation. He submits that this is a case where the failure to provide any evidence of what led to the initial suspicion that Mr Robertson’s returns were inaccurate means that the court should have drawn the inference that there was no rational basis for commencing the informal investigation that is ongoing in this case:  <span style="font-style:italic">R (OAO Das) v SSHD</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 45, [2014] 1 WLR 3538 at </p>

Once the investigation was unlawful, it remains unlawful, and HMRC cannot justify it by reference to any information they have discovered as a result of the investigation as these are “fruits of the poisoned tree”. Even if he is wrong about that, he has a fall-back position: HMRC’s investigation should be stopped save for any specific matters where reasons for HMRC’s concerns have been provided and it can be seen that there are matters which genuinely remain unresolved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">First, it seems to me that, contrary to the submissions made by the appellants, the judge conducted a careful analysis of the course of the investigation and the evidence provided by Mr Brown and concluded that the gist of Mr Brown’s concerns were communicated to Mr Robertson. This was done at the meeting on 3 November 2016 and in a follow-up letter of 21 November 2016, on the judge’s findings. As the investigation progressed, some concerns were addressed, but others remained outstanding and continue to be live concerns in this case. Those findings leave no room for inferring from the absence of evidence that the decision to start the investigation was irrational and without reasoned foundation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Secondly, this court has not been provided with the underlying material that was available to the judge, and is in no position to go behind any of his findings (even if we wished to do so). The course and conduct of the investigation which emerges from the judge’s findings does not on the face of it lead to the conclusion that it was irrational or obviously unfair. The investigation may have been ongoing for a little over two years before it was interrupted by these proceedings, but even that delay is not (on the face of it) so long as to make it unlawful.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">Thirdly, I do not accept that even if unlawfully started the investigation cannot lawfully be continued.  There is no general principle based on “fruits of the poisoned tree” and Mr Moser identified none; instead the general principle is that illegally obtained material remains admissible subject to some particular statutory exceptions. If the investigation can lawfully be continued, HMRC could simply start a new investigation at this point and it is difficult to see what purpose there could be in declaring the investigation to have been unlawfully commenced in these circumstances. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.70in;margin-right:0.00in">As to the fall-back argument maintained by Mr Moser, I agree with the judge that in the absence of any basis for concluding the investigation was being conducted unlawfully, it is not for the court to dictate the way in which the investigation should proceed or to limit its scope. The judge found that Mr Brown’s witness statement indicates what his remaining concerns are and why; and that they are not on the face of it irrational or misconceived. In those circumstances and on the premise that the continuing investigation is lawful, I can see no legitimate basis for the court to step in and micromanage HMRC’s conduct of it. Of course, and again as the judge observed, if the appellants and their advisers are confident that they have provided all that HMRC can reasonably require to check Mr Robertson’s tax returns, they can decline to provide any more. HMRC may take a different view and resort to compulsory powers under schedule 36, but the use of those powers is subject to the supervision of the FTT and there are remedies available to Mr Robertson in that regard. </p>

Judicial review of the exercise of that power is available on ordinary public law grounds but in practice it will take a wholly exceptional case on its legal merits to justify judicial review of a discretionary decision by HMRC to conduct an informal investigation of the kind conducted here.  Finally, the judge was correct to conclude that whatever the test, the circumstances of the appellants’ case did not meet the threshold for the court to intervene on judicial review. </p>
