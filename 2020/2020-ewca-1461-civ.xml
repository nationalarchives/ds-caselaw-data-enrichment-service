	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal from the decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Frances dated 13 September 2019 refusing permission to the appellant, Mr Peter Emiantor, to bring judicial review proceedings to challenge the decision of the respondent, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, dated 3 July 2019 that he is liable to deportation as a foreign criminal.  The appellant contends that the Secretary of State’s prior agreement, or the public law doctrine of legitimate expectation, rendered that decision unlawful. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant entered the UK as a student in 1999.  On 16 November 2015 he was convicted at Southampton Crown Court of offences arising out of an attempted insurance fraud. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment.  This length of sentence meant that, under section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”), the Secretary of State was required to make a deportation order against him.  On 18 January 2016 the appellant was served with a notice of a decision that he is liable to deportation (“the 2016 Notice”). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant appealed against his conviction.  On 14 June 2016 his appeal was dismissed by the single judge.  He renewed his application to the full court, but the renewed application was also not successful, and was dismissed on or about 14 February 2017.  In the meantime, on 15 August 2016, the appellant had been placed in immigration detention at the end of his custodial sentence.  This should not have happened, because section 34(2) of the 2007 Act prevents a deportation order being made under section 32(5) while an appeal or further appeal against the underlying conviction is pending.  The appellant accordingly issued proceedings for judicial review of the 2016 Notice and of his detention in immigration detention which was based on that Notice, coupled with an application for urgent relief. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 15 August 2016, the appellant’s application for urgent relief came before Holgate J who directed the Secretary of State to file an acknowledgement of service by 23 August 2016, and to set out the justification relied on for the continued detention of the appellant.  On 23 August 2016 there was a flurry of activity at the Home Office.  First, the Secretary of State did serve a rudimentary acknowledgment of service on that day in which she explained that she: </p>

On that basis the Claimant has been invited to withdraw his JR application and an open letter (copy attached) was sent to the Claimant on 23 August 2016 [i.e. the same day as the acknowledgement of service].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">That a response had not been received from the appellant on the same day as the letter was sent is hardly surprising, particularly as the appellant was still in custody.  The acknowledgment of service went on to say that if the matter was not settled the Secretary of State “reserved the right to serve further summary grounds”. What the acknowledgement of service did not do is set out any justification for the continued detention of the appellant, as Holgate J had specifically required. </p>

Section 36(5), as then in force, applied paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 3 of the Immigration Act 1971, which permits the imposition of reporting restrictions, to “a person who is liable to be detained under subsection (1)”.  We did not hear argument on whether the restrictions imposed on the appellant on 30 August 2016 were lawful, given the withdrawal of the 2016 Notice.  Section 36(2) only authorises detention “(a) while the Secretary of State considers whether section 32(5) applies, and (b) where the Secretary of State thinks that section 32(5) applies, pending the making of the deportation order.”   </p>

It appears that this caused the Secretary of State to offer the sum of £3,000, because, on 2 April 2019, the appellant’s solicitors, Huneewoth Solicitors, who had recently been instructed, wrote to the GLD asking for 7 days to consider the offer of £3,000 made to the appellant. It seems clear that that offer was also rejected, or at least not accepted, because on 11 April 2019 the GLD emailed the appellant’s solicitors with a further offer to settle, this time for £5,000 plus reasonable legal costs, in full and final settlement of the claim.  This elicited a counter-offer of £7,500 with £650 costs in a letter of 15 April 2019 from the appellant’s solicitors as full and final settlement. On 17 April 2019 the GLD accepted this counter-offer.  They said: </p>

What was under discussion, following the transfer of any damages claim to the County Court, was the settlement of that claim alone.  The damages claim was settled by the exchange of emails of 15 and 17 April 2019, and no further terms were agreed thereafter, despite the Secretary of State’s failure to comment on the various mentions of deportation in the letters.  The letter to the County Court of 22 May 2019, written by the appellant, to the extent that it was suggesting that there was a further term in which the Secretary of State had agreed not to deport the appellant at all, did not represent the actual agreement between the parties.

This included the Secretary of State’s duty under the Act to deport foreign criminals except in closely defined circumstances, and correspondence in which the right to pursue deportation in the light of the outcome of the criminal appeal was reserved.  Moreover, the statements made by the appellant in the subsequent correspondence were in a different context, namely the settlement of a damages claim.

To state the obvious, that is not the same thing as what the appellant himself understood.  For this purpose, the surrounding circumstances which would be known to a person in the appellant’s position on 6 December 2016 are important.   The appellant had been released from immigration detention at the end of August 2016, on the direction of Phillips J, but had been served with the reporting requirement at the same time.  As a result, the appellant had been reporting on a weekly basis at Lunar House from September onwards. There were, however, no deportation proceedings any longer in being, the 2016 Notice having been withdrawn.  A decision had apparently been taken within the Home Office to cancel the reporting requirement, for reasons which do not appear from the materials before us, but at least arguably were connected to a concern over its legality.   It would certainly have been clear to a reasonable person in the appellant’s position that he was no longer required to report.  </p>

The Act emphasises that the deportation of foreign criminals “is conducive to the public good”: see section 32(4).  The appellant’s interpretation of what was meant by the Home Office official is rendered significantly less tenable, given that it involves an acceptance of the notion that the Secretary of State had decided not to comply with a duty imposed on her in the public interest.

First, the Secretary of State had accepted that she could not deport the appellant whilst an appeal against his criminal conviction was pending, and had decided that the 2016 Notice was to be withdrawn.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">All this background suggests that the appellant’s release, and the removal of his reporting requirement were a consequence of the withdrawal of the 2016 Notice in the light of the pending criminal appeal.  It would have required a statement by the Home Office official at Lunar House in the very clearest terms to establish an expectation that there was no question at all of any <span style="font-style:italic">future</span> attempt to deport.  As I have explained, however, the words and deeds of the official were also capable of relating solely to the <span style="font-style:italic">previous </span>attempt to deport.  They were not so clear as to have the meaning advanced by the appellant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment therefore, the case based on legitimate expectation, like that based on agreement, is not made out.  I would add that we did not hear argument on whether it was possible for the Secretary of State to fetter the exercise of her statutory duty in the way contended for by the appellant.  I have proceeded on the assumption that it is, but nothing in my judgment should be taken as endorsing the correctness of my assumption. </p>
