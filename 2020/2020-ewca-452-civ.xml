The further argument on that point was heard at the same time as a separate appeal to the UT concerning TLC in which the same question arose. In the second decision under appeal, by Nugee J and Judge Herrington dated 23 January 2019 [2017] UKUT 484 (TCC) (“UT2”), the UT held that the devolution arrangements did not mean that Item 9 breached the principle of fiscal neutrality. As a consequence, the UT allowed appeals by the Respondents (“HMRC”) against two earlier decisions of the First-tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) (“the FTT”): a decision concerning LIFE by Judge Charles Hellier and William Haarer dated 23 June 2016 [2016] UKFTT 444 (TC) (“FTT1”) and a decision concerning TLC by Judge Barbara Mosedale dated 13 June 2017 [2017] UKFTT 492 (TC) (“FTT2”). </p>

It considered that day care of vulnerable adults needed to be regulated as much as residential care. Nevertheless, TLC did not argue before the FTT that it was regulated by the CQC. TLC argued that it was “state-regulated” within Item 9 because its staff were checked by the Disclosure and Barring Service and TLC could only employ staff who were checked. The FTT did not accept that argument, and it has not been pursued by TLC subsequently.  </p>

In those circumstances, it is not sufficient for LIFE merely to rely upon the fact that the FTT described LIFE as being “registered with” the Council. As counsel for LIFE accepted, LIFE must identify the provisions of CA 2014 which imposed a duty on the Council to approve or register LIFE, or gave it the power to do so, in a relevant manner.  </p>

The context is that Note (8) provides a definition of “state-regulated” for the purpose of determining whether the supply by a private welfare institution or agency of “welfare services” is exempted by Item 9. Note (6) provides that, in the case of services supplied by a state-regulated private welfare institution (the words “or agency” evidently should have been added when Item 9 was amended to include them, but were not), “welfare services” includes “only those services in respect of which the institution is so regulated”. It follows that what is required is that the institution or agency is “approved, licensed, registered or exempted from registration by any Minister or other authority pursuant to a provision of a public general Act” in respect of the supply of welfare services.  </p>

The UT accepted that this was a relevant comparison and that it supported HMRC’s case that the provisions of CA 2014 were “insufficient” to make LIFE “state-regulated” (UT1 at [70]). I disagree. The only question is whether the provisions of CA 2014 relied upon by LIFE satisfy the test laid down by Note (8). The existence of another statutory regime of regulation is not relevant to that question. </p>

Section 5(1) imposes a duty on local authorities to promote diversity and quality in the provision of services for meeting care and support needs, and section 5(5) requires local authorities to have regard to that duty in meeting an adult’s needs for care and support or a carer’s needs for support.

He submitted that LIFE was authorised by the Council to provide welfare services on behalf of the Council under sections 8(2)(b) and 79(1) of CA 2014, and that meant that it was “approved” or “registered” by the Council pursuant to those provisions for the purposes of Note (8). </p>

First, I do not consider that it accurately characterises the basis upon which LIFE provides its services. The FTT made no finding that the Council had delegated its functions under section 8(2)(b) to LIFE, and its findings are inconsistent with that proposition. As explained above, it is clear from the FTT’s findings that LIFE’s services are provided pursuant to section 8(2)(a) and 8(2)(c). (In the case of TLC, it is evident that TLC’s services are mainly provided pursuant to section 8(2)(c).) Neither section 8(2)(a) nor section 8(2)(c) requires or empowers the local authority to “approve” or “register” the service provider in respect of welfare services so as to make the provider “state-regulated” within Note (8). </p>

As the UT pointed out, section 79(6) deems the acts and omissions of the local authority’s delegate to be the acts and omissions of the local authority, but it is not suggested that the Council is itself regulated in relation to the provision of welfare services (UT1 at [74]). Even if the Council were itself “state-regulated” within Note (8), that would not mean that its delegate was approved or registered under CA 2014 in relation to the provision of welfare services. (The Council is, of course, exempt for a different reason, namely that it is a public body within Item 9(c).)    </p>

If that exclusionary criterion infringes the principle of fiscal neutrality, then LIFE can rely upon the direct effect of Article 132(1)(g) to claim the benefit of the exemption.

The former may be either “state-regulated” or charities, which are not “state-regulated”, but are required to be established solely for charitable purposes which are for the public benefit and are subject to supervision by the Charity Commission. I consider that, viewed through the eyes of the consumer, just as there is a significant difference between welfare services provided by private welfare bodies which are not “stateregulated” and those which are, so too there is a significant difference between welfare services provided by private welfare bodies which are not “state-regulated” and those which are provided by charities. Many third sector organisations are charities, and in my view consumers do see them differently to unregulated private providers. By contrast, I consider that the average consumer would see little relevant difference between services provided by charities and those provided by stateregulated private providers.  </p>

The UT’s reasoning focuses upon the public benefit test. As the UT explained, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Independent Schools Council v Charity Commission </span>[2011] UKUT 421 (TCC), [2012] Ch 214 the Upper Tribunal held at [44] that there are two related aspects of public benefit: the first is that the nature of the purpose itself must be such as to be a benefit to the community and the second is that those who may benefit from the carrying out of the purpose must be sufficiently numerous and identified in such a manner as to constitute a section of the public. But the fact that a charity’s purposes must be for the public benefit in that sense does not necessarily mean that those purposes are “devoted to social wellbeing”. “Social wellbeing” concerns the wellbeing of members of society. </p>

I am less sure, however, that all such bodies are “devoted to social wellbeing” within the meaning of Article 132(1)(g). It seems to me that it may be arguable that “devoted to social wellbeing” should be interpreted as meaning (as I understood counsel for LIFE in effect to submit) “exclusively concerned with social wellbeing”. In saying that this may be arguable, I am not saying that I accept that the point really is arguable. The argument relies upon giving effect to the word “devoted” in the English text of Article 132(1)(g) (which is defined in the <span style="font-style:italic">Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</span> as meaning “vowed; dedicated; consecrated”). But that invites the question of whether the other texts of the provision contain similar wording. Since the hearing, I have noted that no equivalent word appears in the French, German or Italian texts; but I am not competent to check all the language versions. Moreover, this is a point that was barely argued on either side. If it was right, however, a charity whose objects included the provision of welfare services, but which extended to the provision of services which were not “devoted to social wellbeing”, would qualify for exemption on the UT’s interpretation of Item 9(a), but not on a proper construction of Article 132(1)(g). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">LIFE’s third submission, and TLC’s contention, is that Item 9 contravenes the principle of fiscal neutrality because of the differential treatment of providers of day care services in England and Wales on the one hand and providers of day care services in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is because the provision of such services is a devolved matter under the United Kingdom’s devolution arrangements. As discussed above, in England the provision of day care services is not “stateregulated”, and in particular, it is not regulated by the CQC under HSCA 2008. The position is the same in Wales. It is common ground that, by contrast, the provision of day care services in Scotland and Northern Ireland is “state-regulated” by virtue of legislation passed by the devolved administrations in April 2002 and 2005 respectively. Accordingly, LIFE and TLC contend that there is a contravention of the principle of fiscal neutrality because day care providers in Scotland and Northern Ireland benefit from the exemption whereas day care providers in England and Wales do not. </p>

It is accepted, or has already been found, that the way in which it exercised that discretion in 2002 was rational and lawful. We see no basis on which it could be said that as introduced in 2002 it breached the principle of fiscal neutrality as it applied uniformly across the UK to all private suppliers of welfare services. To the extent that there is now a difference between such suppliers in England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland and Northern Ireland on the other hand, this is not caused by any lack of neutrality in the VAT legislation, but by the fact that the UK has devolved regulation of this sector to the devolved nations and they have made different decisions in that respect, as they are entitled to do.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">Counsel for LIFE submitted that this reasoning was wrong in law for two reasons. One of these I have already considered and rejected, namely that the UT was wrong to conclude that “state-regulated” private providers were not similar to non-state regulated private providers. The other reason advanced by counsel for LIFE was that the UT was wrong to focus exclusively on the effect of the VAT legislation. The UK, he submitted, was required by the principle of fiscal neutrality to ensure that similar services were accorded similar VAT treatment throughout the UK. In the present case the combined effect of the UK VAT legislation and the Scottish and Northern Irish regulatory regimes meant that similar services were treated differently. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">I do not accept this submission. In my view the UT was correct to say that Item 9 does not discriminate between private welfare providers located in the different nations of the UK. It does discriminate between state-regulated providers and non-state regulated providers, but for the reasons given above that does not contravene the principle of fiscal neutrality. Given that it is not a breach of that principle to deny the benefit of the exemption to non-state regulated providers, the reason why certain providers do not qualify as being “state-regulated” is immaterial. Whether it is because they are located in a nation which does not regulate day care services, or for some other reason, the result is the same, namely that they are perceived by consumers as significantly differently to state-regulated providers. </p>

It is only necessary to mention two of these. First, counsel for TLC placed considerable emphasis on the legislative history which the UT summarised in UT2 at [32]. As the UT rightly held, however, this is of little assistance in determining whether or not the current legislation breaches the principle of fiscal neutrality. Secondly, counsel for TLC complained that the UT had not considered the reasoning of the FTT in FTT2 or explicitly identified any error of law in that reasoning. There is nothing in this point. The issue before the UT was a question of law. In reaching a different conclusion to the FTT, the UT necessarily concluded that the FTT had erred in law. </p>

Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider what the CJEU meant by saying that national authorities were entitled to take into account “regional” legislation (see paragraph 44 above).                </p>

A charity whose objects allowed it to pursue social wellbeing but also to do other things would not be entitled to exemption, and that, presumably, even if in practice it did nothing but provide welfare services.

A charity of that kind would be debarred from exemption, but so too would one with narrower objects </p>

Nor, as I see it, would the effects be limited to charities. A non-charitable entity which provided care services in respect of which it was regulated would not, it appears, be eligible for exemption if it also did something else or its objects were broad enough to allow it to do so. VATA 1994 defines “welfare services” so that, in the case of services supplied by a state-regulated private welfare institution, the expression “includes only those services in respect of which the institution is so regulated”. If, however, an organisation also provided services which did not advance “social wellbeing”, or even if its objects enabled it to take that course, it should not be afforded exemption. Thus, a body supplying regulated day care services in Scotland would not necessarily benefit from exemption. That would depend on whether it undertook another kind of activity as well or was at least able to do so. </p>

(Thus, the French text speaks of bodies “reconnus comme ayant un caractère social par l'État membre concerné” and the German of bodies “mit sozialem Charakter”.) Moreover, the context and purposes of Article 132(1)(g) seem to me to confirm that it should not be construed as if it read “exclusively<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>devoted to social wellbeing”. I can see no reason why the provision should have been intended to produce arbitrary consequences such as those I have mentioned in the previous paragraph. The intention was evidently that a body should be “recognised … as being devoted to social wellbeing” in respect of the relevant transaction. It would make little sense to preclude a Member State from granting exemption in respect of a supply promoting social wellbeing just because the supplier also supplied, or had objects permitting it to supply, different services. </p>
