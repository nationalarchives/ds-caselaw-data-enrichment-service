	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The appellant, Mr Beadle, is a taxpayer who participated in a tax avoidance scheme through a partnership, Ingenious Film Partners LLP (“the LLP”), which was involved in investments in films, in the year ending 5 April 2005. The LLP entered into arrangements (that were “DOTAS arrangements” for the purposes of s.219(5) Finance Act 2014 (“FA 2014”)) by which it claimed to realise a trading loss for that (and other) years. Mr Beadle claimed as a partner of the LLP, to carry back his share of that loss to reduce his taxable income for the tax year ending 5 April 2002 and he obtained relief by way of a repayment to him from The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) of approximately £100,000 calculated by reference to income tax he had originally paid for that tax year.  HMRC enquired into the LLP’s tax return for (among other years) the tax year ending 5 April 2005, and on 30 November 2012 issued the LLP with a closure notice reducing the LLP’s trading loss to nil. An appeal against the closure notice by the LLP is ongoing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This appeal concerns two decisions of the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) (the “FTT”) made in the course of an appeal by Mr Beadle against a penalty notice for non-payment of a Partner Payment Notice (referred to below as a “PPN”). The first decision by FTT Judge Jonathan Richards held that the FTT did not have jurisdiction in a penalty appeal to entertain a challenge to the lawfulness or validity of the underlying PPN. The second decision by FTT Judge Rupert Jones held that Mr Beadle had neither a reasonable excuse for late payment of the sum required by the PPN, nor were there special circumstances justifying a reduction in the penalty. </p>

As with any public law decision, in general, a PPN once given is presumed valid unless and until successfully challenged and in the event of a successful challenge (in a court of competent jurisdiction), it will be recognised as having had no legal effect. Furthermore, the FTT is a statutory tribunal and has no inherent jurisdiction, nor any jurisdiction to grant judicial review. However, that does not mean that the FTT never has jurisdiction to determine public law questions. A tribunal that has no judicial review jurisdiction may nevertheless have to decide questions of public law in the course of exercising the jurisdiction which it does have: see for example the discussion in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Oxfam</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">v HMRC</span> [2009] EWHC 3078 (Sales J at [68]). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The central question on this appeal is whether the FTT does have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the underlying PPN in the penalty appeal proceedings with which this court is concerned. This depends on whether the general rule (derived in <span style="text-decoration:underline">O’Reilly v Mackman</span> [1983] 2 AC 237 at 285) that it is an abuse of the process of the court to permit a person to challenge a public law decision by means other than judicial review, applies here as HMRC contend, to prevent Mr Beadle from challenging the validity of the underlying PPN in the penalty notice appeal; or whether this is a case </p>

Two broad reasons were given as follows: </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“44. In our judgment Judge Richards was correct to hold in the present case that the FTT had no jurisdiction to entertain the Appellant’s challenge to the PPN for the following reasons. First, we accept that the authorities establish the exception or limit to the exception to the exclusivity principle which we have stated in paragraph 30 above, but we do not accept counsel for the Appellant’s argument that the availability of a defence to enforcement action on public law grounds can only be excluded by express statutory language. In our judgment, the availability of such a defence can also be excluded by necessary implication from the statutory scheme. This is in effect what the Divisional Court and the House of Lords respectively concluded in <span style="font-style:italic">Quietlynn Ltd v Plymouth City Council </span>[1988] QB 114 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Wicks </span>[1998] AC 93 as analysed by the House of Lords in </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:0.99in"><span style="font-size:11.5pt">45. Secondly, in the present case we consider that the statutory scheme concerning PPNs and penalty notices does by necessary implication exclude the possibility of a challenge by the taxpayer to a PPN on public law grounds in the context of an appeal to the FTT against a penalty notice. This is for two reasons. The first is the fact that Parliament has provided rights of appeal against the underlying tax assessment and against a penalty notice, but not against a PPN. In the case of a PPN, Parliament has only provided a right to make representations (within a specified time limit) which HMRC are required to consider. In our view, the absence of a right of appeal against PPNs is a clear indication that Parliament does not intend taxpayers to be able to challenge PPNs on appeal to the FTT. If taxpayers cannot do so directly, then it would be very odd to permit them to do so indirectly by way of an appeal against a penalty. The second reason, which reinforces the first, is that permitting such a challenge would be contrary to the design and purpose of the PPN regime, as to which we agree with the observations of Judge Gargan we have quoted above.</span>” </p>

Judge Jones concluded that even if Mr Beadle had a reasonable belief, subjectively, objectively or both, and based upon professional advice, that he was not liable to pay the understated partner tax liability, this could not form a reasonable excuse for the failure to pay the PPN within the payment period. Rather, a reasonable taxpayer in that position would make payment of the sum under the PPN within the payment period and pursue whatever challenge was available to the underlying liability in the meantime, irrespective of his or her reasonable belief as to the merits of the substantive challenge. </p>

In so doing he is seeking only to exercise the ordinary right of any individual to defend an action against him on the ground that he is not liable for the whole sum claimed by the plaintiff. Moreover he puts forward his defence as a matter of right, whereas in an application for judicial review, success would require an exercise of the court’s discretion in his favour.…… I find it impossible to accept that the right to challenge the decision of a local authority in course of defending an action for non-payment can have been swept away by Order 53, which was directed to introducing a procedural reform.

Scrutiny of the particular statutory context is required to determine whether a court hearing a criminal or civil case has jurisdiction to rule on a defence based on arguments of invalidity of subordinate legislation or administrative acts under it; but there is a strong presumption that Parliament does not legislate to prevent fundamental rights of access to the courts, including by way of collateral public law challenges, save by clear words. Accordingly, and contrary to the UT judgment at [44], he submits it can never be the case that the right to raise a public law argument by way of defence to enforcement action can be excluded by necessary implication. </p>

The recipient of a PPN must pay the sum identified as the potential tax advantage within 90 days from the notice being given or, if challenged, within 30 days of receipt of HMRC’s response to representations. The whole purpose and policy intention of this detailed statutory scheme would be subverted if it were open to a taxpayer like Mr Beadle not only to sit back without challenging the PPN and await penalty notice or enforcement proceedings before seeking to challenge it; but also to retain the disputed tax during the course of a potentially lengthy and convoluted appeals process that would or might follow. In substance although not in form that would amount to a statutory appeal by the back door against the PPN, for which Parliament has expressly not provided, and during the course of which the disputed tax would be retained by the taxpayer, enabling him to enjoy the cash flow benefits that the scheme is designed to remove. </p>

The PPN is in that sense an interim decision determining where the disputed tax should sit, which may be rescinded (and the monies obtained repaid with interest) if the final decision in the substantive tax dispute is resolved in favour of the taxpayer. In that context the deliberate omission of statutory appeal rights against the PPN itself is both rational and explicable as Ms Aparna Nathan QC and Ms Marika Lemos on behalf of HMRC submit. It is a clear indication that Parliament does not intend taxpayers to be able to make direct challenges to PPNs on appeal to the FTT in circumstances where the underlying tax dispute affords full appeal rights, and by necessary implication, indirect challenges in the course of penalty or other proceedings cannot have been intended either. </p>

The availability of full appeal rights in relation to the underlying tax liability is not undermined, as Mr Gordon submits, by the fact that where a limited liability partnership is the vehicle used for the purposes of the tax avoidance scheme in question, the appeal is conducted in the name of the LLP rather than the individual partners themselves. As Ms Nathan submits, the LLP falls to be treated for income tax purposes as if it were a partnership, and is therefore transparent for income tax purposes and not itself subject to income tax or corporation tax. Instead, the individual partners (who are members of the LLP) are liable to income tax (or obtain relief from income tax) in respect of their proportionate share of the LLP’s profits or losses. The scheme of the legislation ensures that any dispute as to matters in the LLP’s tax return are dealt with at the partnership level (by means of full rights of appeal afforded to the LLP in respect of any amendment made or conclusion expressed in the partnership return closure notice). The outcome of that dispute is then required to be reflected in mandatory adjustments to the partners’ individual tax returns under section 28B(4) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 that are not subject to a separate right of appeal to the FTT.<span style="font-size:11.5pt"> There is no unfairness in that (as this court made clear in </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:11.5pt">R (on</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-size:11.5pt">application of Rowe) v HMRC</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> [2017] EWCA Civ 2105, [2018] 1 WLR 3039, Arden LJ at </span></p>

The statute requires that the taxpayer [pay the tax] in the interim while the underlying liability, if challenged, can be resolved. If the taxpayer is successful in their challenge to the liability they will receive the appropriate rebate from HMRC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.00in">“…If the judicial review were to fail then the liability to penalties would not be removed but there would be a statutory right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal if HMRC were not satisfied that the existence of the judicial review proceedings was a reasonable excuse for not paying the penalties. The taxpayers would have the opportunity first of all to make representations to HMRC and, if those fail, to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in order to persuade the First-tier Tribunal that they had a reasonable excuse for not paying the penalties. It seems to me that whether or not the claimants accede to the PPN and pay the sum which is said to be due, pending the outcome of the judicial review, or do not pay it, in neither case is the judicial review rendered nugatory.” </p>

Furthermore it is implicit in her judgement that such a challenge can be made in the FTT as otherwise, the penalty appeal procedure would not have been a reason to refuse interim relief sought before the High Court. He submits accordingly that the FTT was wrong to decide Mr Beadle’s appeal without regard to his genuine belief about the unlawfulness of the calculation underlying the PPN. </p>

Rather, what she said was simply that it would be open to taxpayers to appeal to the FTT on the question of reasonable excuse in the event of an unsuccessful application for judicial review. </p>
