	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns a 13 year old school girl, referred to as ZK, who brings these proceedings by her mother and litigation friend, HK. ZK is totally blind as a result of a brain tumour, and partially deaf, in consequence of the same tumour. In consequence of her severe visual impairment and resulting special educational needs, she requires a high level of support. She has been and is being educated in mainstream schools in the London Borough of Redbridge (referred to as “Redbridge”), the respondent to this appeal. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The essential challenge pursued on ZK’s behalf by HK is to the failure by Redbridge to adopt a “centralised model” of specialist educational support for children with visual impairment in mainstream schools whereby the local authority recruits and employs a central pool of specialist teaching assistants who are then seconded out to the school which the child attends. Instead they adopt a “decentralised model” under which it is the school that recruits and employs a specialist teaching assistant, if and when it has a child attending with that particular need. The decentralised model is said to be incapable at a systems level, of meeting the special educational needs of disabled children like ZK who have a high level of special needs support, including support from specialist teaching assistants, who are in turn, supported by qualified teachers of the visually impaired (“QTVIs”). Redbridge contracts with a specialist provider, the Joseph Clarke Educational Service (“JCES”), to provide the services of QTVI teachers, and to train the specialist teaching assistants. Under the Redbridge model, however, it neither employs those QTVIs, nor employs or trains the teaching assistants who work with visually impaired pupils in mainstream schools. Instead they are employed by the schools in which they work. This is the “decentralised model” under challenge. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In her first witness statement HK identified the problems with a decentralised model as including that because teaching assistants are employed by the school and responsible only to the head teacher of a school, there is no central input from the local authority which has the responsibility to secure the provision of special educational support for the disabled pupil. That means that teaching assistants often have no specialist training, for example braille knowledge and/or qualifications and almost never have skills in STEM subjects; and there is no opportunity for continuous professional development for general teaching assistants under a decentralised model. It is her case that this model limits the pool of appropriately skilled staff available to support children like ZK, leaving them vulnerable to having no adequately skilled support as required on transition to a different school (for example, transition from primary to secondary school) or if the designated teaching assistant is absent and in consequence, is inherently unlawful and at odds with Redbridge's compliance with the statutory obligations it owes to disabled pupils with special educational needs. HK also said that the decentralised model results in a lack of choice of schools in Redbridge for pupils like ZK, and a risk of them being forced out of mainstream schools into specialist education at long distance from home with the difficulties (social and travelling time) that entails. </p>

He acknowledged evidence both from HK, and from the mother of another child who suffers severe visual impairment that was critical of how educational matters relating to their children had been addressed on occasion (and that might afford the basis for specific challenge).  However, this challenge was a systemic challenge at a generic level, to the general arrangements in place.  He concluded that at the generic level, the arrangements made by Redbridge for the provision of services from JCES to support the teaching of visually impaired pupils in mainstream schools are not such as to be irrational, and are not such as to warrant an inference that they have been entered into without due regard for relevant considerations. </p>

The fact that the very purpose of the arrangements Redbridge makes with JCES from year to year is to ensure that what is required to meet the assessed needs of visually impaired pupils is available, means the very purpose of the exercise was to seek the elimination of discrimination between those pupils and other pupils. That purpose was said to run through to Redbridge’s decision on what services should be secured from JCES. Accordingly this claim also failed. </p>

Mr Bowen QC contended that what was required were teaching assistants who were not only trained to at least grade 2 UEB braille but had also been awarded the formal qualification confirming the attainment of that level of competence, a process that takes at least a year. He relied on what he submitted is Swift J’s finding to this effect at [4] where he held: “<span style="font-style:italic">The teaching assistants must be trained in contracted UEB. Contracted Braille is the Grade 2 UEB code, which is materially different from the Uncontracted, Grade 1 code.</span>” For Redbridge Ms Rhee submitted that Swift J did not make a finding that the qualification was required; there was no agreement between the parties that this should be specified in the EHC plan, and instead it was agreed and specified that the teaching assistants would be trained in contracted UEB braille. By implication, she submits, it was understood that the teaching assistants may not yet have obtained their grade 2 qualification. </p>

He found that they should be trained in contracted UEB braille. There was evidence to support that finding. First, it appears from the witness statement of Conny Kaweesa, a Conciliation and Tribunal Officer who had conduct of the statutory appeal to the Tribunal on behalf of Redbridge, that this was a contested issue in the appeal lodged on 3 September 2017 on behalf of ZK. In particular she makes clear that it was disputed by Redbridge that ZK’s teaching assistants would need to have a braille qualification in grade 2 UEB braille. Secondly, the EHC plan, read as a whole, indicates that there was no requirement for the teaching assistants to have achieved the grade 2 qualification at the point when they started working with ZK in Year 7: the references to “grade 2” in the EHC plan does not appear in section F, but rather in other sections that do not deal with the provision of resources required. For example, it appears in section A, dealing with ZK’s aspirations; section B, dealing with ZK’s own needs (but without reference to her teaching assistants); and section E, dealing with outcomes. <span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>This is also consistent with the fact that ZK was herself developing the use of grade 2 UEB braille </p>

JCES also provides the services of a habilitation specialist (equivalent to 0.25 of one full-time employee) and provides administrative support staff (again equivalent to 0.25 of one full-time employee). </p>

This includes but is not limited to, training the specialist teaching assistants. The training concerns all matters relating to the teaching of VI pupils, including teaching Braille and how to use specialised equipment: see the contract specification at paragraph 5.2.2. Redbridge's evidence is that this part of the support includes providing annual courses for teaching staff, and INSET training at specific schools based on the particular needs of the VI pupils at those schools. Redbridge's evidence also points out that the training for teaching assistants is tailored to the specific needs of the child that teaching assistant has been recruited to support – for example, taking account of whether the child uses Braille, and taking account of what is needed by way of lesson preparation for that child. The QTVI teachers provided by JCES provide an outreach service, i.e. they visit relevant mainstream schools to provide on-site training and assistance to the relevant teaching staff. The habilitation specialist also provides advice and assistance to relevant schools designed to develop the pupil's independent skills. This advice includes audit of a school premise.” </p>

Evidence from Mr Vic Gibson, (a QTVI who, until his retirement in 2016 worked for Peterborough City Council) described Peterborough’s Sensory Support Service which employed a number of QTVIs and specialist teaching assistants, most working in schools which visually impaired pupils were encouraged to attend. Mr Gibson also explained that when such pupils chose not to attend those schools the Sensory Support Service provided an outreach service to the schools which they did attend. This or some other type of “centralised model” is relied on by ZK as enabling a visually impaired pupil’s transition from one mainstream school to another, with a suitably trained teaching assistant able to be deployed immediately to the new school. </p>

RNIB data (published in 2015) indicated that 45% of local authorities did not themselves employ the teaching assistants provided to visually impaired pupils. However, the 55% of local authorities that did employ teaching assistants directly only accounted for the employment of 495 teaching assistants. The vast majority of teaching assistants, some 2,600, worked in the areas of the remaining 45% of local authorities, and were directly employed by the mainstream schools in which they worked. </p>

Parents are given two months to consider and reach a decision. Redbridge's evidence includes summaries of how this process has worked in two other cases. There is also evidence of how the process worked in the Claimant's case. So far as concerns the Claimant's position, I have seen a document dating from October 2017 which set out options for the way in which specialised teaching assistant provision would be made, depending on which of two schools the Claimant transferred.

The needs of any VI pupil may vary from child to child: for example whether the child uses Braille and if so to what level; this means that the skills required from each teaching assistant will also vary. I make this point only because a significant part of the argument before me relied on the time that would be needed to train a teaching assistant in UEB Braille either from scratch to Grade 1 or from Grade 1 to Grade 2. I have referred to the present position in Redbridge already. In Redbridge there are now five Braillists, but prior to these pupils there had been no pupils using Braille in mainstream schools in Redbridge for some twenty years. There was further evidence from JCES to the effect that although JCES provides services to four boroughs including Redbridge, there is only one pupil outside Redbridge who uses Braille. If there were a centralised system I suspect that that too would require recruitment by reference to anticipated or notified future needs, since it would be unrealistic to expect any local authority to retain as a matter of contingency, a number of teaching assistants covering a range of skills to address a low incidence but high level need such as VI.  </p>

If this happened without prior notice, it is likely the receiving school might struggle to find a suitably qualified teaching assistant in short order. However, the present arrangements are not in my view unlawful because of the possibility that they may not be able to address such a set of circumstance without delay. For the reasons already indicated, I have significant doubts that any realistic centralised model would be able to fare much better in this set of circumstances. In any event, were such a situation to arise in Redbridge, it would always be possible for Redbridge to bridge any gap in provision by seeking further services from JCES.” </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Bowen criticised these findings on a number of grounds. First, in his submission they do not address the fact that parents are entitled to appeal to the Tribunal to challenge the school named in a child’s EHC plan and the Redbridge model must therefore be able to but currently cannot take account of this entitlement in terms of any forward planning it undertakes to ensure that the necessary resource has been secured in time. Secondly, he challenges the conclusion that “<span style="font-style:italic">it would always be possible for Redbridge to bridge any gap in provision by seeking further services from JCES</span>” (at [24] set out above) and submits that the possibility of securing additional services from JCES cannot realistically compensate for gaps in the provision of specialist teaching assistant support given that JCES does not provide in-classroom support, but limits its services to advice, training and the provision of QTVIs. Thirdly and more broadly, he is critical of the fact that the judge did not spell out the evidence relied upon in reaching the conclusions he did on the time lag issue. To the extent that he identified specific evidence (for example the Joint OFSTED and CQC Inspection Report findings set out in a letter dated 25 July 2018) Mr Bowen criticised the judge’s approach as superficial: the evidence did not support his conclusions.  The fact that at a micro level some students are accommodated is no answer to the point that without a bank of centrally employed UEB qualified teaching assistants ready to start for each low incidence high need VI pupil, there is a built-in, systemic time lag problem with Redbridge’s model. Moreover, the judge failed to address other relevant evidence, including a critical paper dated 6 June 2018 (exhibited to the first witness statement of Mr Vic Gibson), prepared by VIEW, a professional organisation representing the education workforce that supports children and young people with vision impairment (or VI). </p>

The thrust of Ms Stanley’s evidence is that, where parental preference is expressed at a sufficiently early stage, training for the teaching assistants employed by the relevant school begins so as to accommodate the request and the likelihood of an appeal reduces.

So far as ZK is concerned, her EHC plan identified the potential need for one hour per day of additional QTVI support to provide marking and overwriting of her braille work in the event that her teachers or teaching assistants did not have the necessary expertise in braille in the first term at Oaks Park, and the increased budget was in part to cater for this additional spend.

Ms Stanley said that a product of this school-led, JCES-facilitated model, has been the development of Oaks Park High School since September 2013 into a highly resourced and expert VI placement. She said the system adopted by Redbridge enabled parental preference (subject to statutory grounds for declining a particular school choice) to be accommodated while at the same time building capacity for a high level of VI specialist provision in one of Redbridge’s schools and the capacity through JCES and the early notification system to build other provision elsewhere in the borough. She said, “<span style="font-style:italic">Redbridge has never had a situation where a placement for a child or young person with VI was not ready in time</span>”. </p>

The paper calls for a comprehensive review of the current system of provision for children and young people with visual impairment on the basis that the current system is said no longer to be fit for purpose, but it is clear that the real issue is one of resource and the perceived need for ring fenced special educational needs funding so that specialist provision is made available.

The witness statement from Lesley Carty, the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator at the school the Claimant attends explains the way in which the specialist teaching assistants at that school work. There are four Braille-trained teaching assistants at the school. They work specifically to support the VI pupils at the school. There is no suggestion that they have been called away from those duties to undertake other work, either regularly or at all. This impression that the risk of this is low is reinforced by the job description for the teaching assistants. Although the document is stated to be non-contractual, the job description makes it clear that the line of reporting for the specialist teaching assistant is through the school's Inclusion Manager (the manager with specific responsibility for the provision of special educational needs at the school). This reporting line must significantly reduce, if not remove, the risk that a teaching assistant would be redeployed away from specialist work. There is also a further practical consideration. The specialist teaching assistants may be employed by each school, but their positions are funded by Redbridge. In the event that a specialist teaching assistant was redeployed away from specialist duties either permanently or from time to time, I see no reason why it would not be open to Redbridge to require the school to stop that practice.  </p>

Even though under such arrangements, Redbridge would be the employer, the specialist teaching assistant would be seconded to the school and would fall under the day-to-day control of the senior staff at the school. If a school were minded to redeploy specialist teaching assistants in the way the Claimant suggests (and I note once again, there is no evidence at all that this has happened at the Claimant's present school) it could try to do that even if secondment arrangements were in place. If it did, the local authority employer would no doubt act to bring that state of affairs to an end. But that scenario would be little different from the pupil's perspective from that which could, also in theory, arise under Redbridge's present model. Put shortly, neither set of arrangements removes the possibility that a school might attempt some form of subversion; no set of arrangements would be fail-safe in such circumstances. But there is no evidence to support any contention that that is the basis on which I should approach this matter. The evidence goes in the other direction and indicates that where specialist teaching assistants are in place to assist specific pupils, those arrangements are not abused by schools.  </p>

Any absence of any teacher is capable of having some adverse impact on the education of the pupils affected. However, I do not consider the possibility of sick leave is such as to render Redbridge's present arrangements unlawful. Cover arrangements can be made for short-term absences. At the school the Claimant attends there are four specialist teaching assistants. Apart from that there is the possibility that Redbridge could seek assistance from JCES to cover a sickness absence, perhaps in the form of additional short-term assistance from a QTVI. The fact that Redbridge may not hold in reserve a fully-trained substitute (which I take to be the Claimant's point for this purpose about a centralised system) does not render the present arrangements inherently unlawful. It is in the nature of any arrangement which requires teaching staff to be available that adjustments may have to be made from time to time to deal with unexpected circumstances.  </p>

Each is critical of how on occasions, matters relating to the education of their children have been addressed. But the issue in this claim is not directed to the specifics of individual cases. Rather, the challenge is at a generic level, to the general arrangements in place. What happens on any particular occasion may be the subject of specific challenge which may or may not succeed on its merits. However, at the generic level, the arrangements made by Redbridge for the provision of services from JCES to support the teaching of VI pupils in mainstream schools are not such as to be irrational, and are not such as to warrant an inference that they have been entered into without due regard for relevant considerations. This disposes of Ground 1.” </p>

Mr Bowen was unable to say how many reserve teaching assistants and trained to what particular level of specialist skill would be required in this model. Further, Mr Hoque’s evidence makes clear that having made enquiries of other local authorities with in-house VI services, he found <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> examples of local authorities maintaining a bank of reserve specialist teaching assistants. That is unsurprising in my view, in circumstances where there is always a shortage of suitably qualified staff and on the face of it, to have a potentially idle pool of reserve specialist teaching assistants to provide cover as and when, appears both unrealistic and unsustainable. </p>

However, again as he recognised, the claim was not directed at individual failures, but at the systemic level. At that level, cover was available at Oaks Park in terms of there being four specialist VI teaching assistants employed. Moreover, because ZK has two teaching assistants specified for her, one providing classroom support and the other preparing resources, they are interchangeable and can step in to cover an unexpected absence. Ms Stanley also said that if both teaching assistants are unexpectedly absent, JCES support can be called upon to provide advice and support to teaching assistants allocated by the school to cover the absence within the provision for QTVI support made, and we were told that the school can contact JCES directly and is not required to go through Redbridge. </p>

The outcome of that assessment (referred to as an "environmental audit") was that the school site was not suitable for the Claimant. In addition, significant building works were due to commence at the school in September 2018. That too made it impracticable for the Claimant to attend that school.

The arrangements that Redbridge has in place for managing school transfers between Year 6 and Year 7 do permit a lead time that ought to be long enough to allow time to recruit and train a specialist teaching assistant. Redbridge's evidence on the steps taken in the Claimant's case indicates that Redbridge has good lines of communication with its mainstream schools on special needs matters.

I have referred above to the evidence of efforts made by Redbridge to accommodate parental preference in terms of choice of school for ZK. Both Anne Webster and Joena Stanley were extensively involved in consulting with her parents and liaising with relevant schools. Specialist analysis and an environmental audit was conducted by JCES in relation to both Wanstead High School and Oaks Park. There is no reason to infer that the same consultation, liaison and analysis would not have been conducted in relation to Seven Kings School and Woodbridge High, had these schools been identified. It is inevitable in circumstances where a child has a low incidence but high level need such as visual impairment that a school without experience of meeting such a need might require engagement by the local authority about the services that would be available (whether in terms of funding or the provision of services by JCES) to enable such a school to accommodate such a pupil. That need is catered for by the consultation provision in section 39(2) of the 2014 Act referred to above, and the evidence demonstrates Redbridge’s proactive engagement in this regard. </p>

Inevitably, the earlier that choice is made the easier it will be to accommodate it. Here, the process was protracted, and Valentine School and Isaac Newton School were not notified until relatively late on because Wanstead High was preferred (but ultimately found not to be a practicable choice for environmental, not other reasons). Again, there is no reason to infer that the same extensive engagement would not have taken place with these schools had the choice been made earlier in the process. Moreover, once a chosen school is identified and specified in the EHC plan, it is not open to a school to refuse to accommodate the student in question (see section 43 of the 2014 Act). The section 42 duty arises at that point and the local authority must ensure that the specified provision is secured. There is no evidence to suggest that this did not or would not have occurred. </p>

The Claimant's circumstances are a particular example of circumstances of such pupils. Where such high-level needs require the presence of a specialist teaching assistant, it is likely that some time will be needed to recruit and train that assistant. But it seems to me that this will be so regardless of whether the local authority concerned works to a centralised model or a decentralised one. The premise for the Claimant's submissions as to the virtues of a centralised system presuppose that under any such arrangements the local authority would employ a sufficient number and range of specialist training assistants so as to be able to cover any/all particular needs that might fall to be met. If that is not the premise then the lead-time problems the Claimant identifies would also be a feature of a centralised model. That premise seems to me to be unrealistic. It would require local authorities to retain that range of reserve teaching assistants indefinitely, on the off-chance that a pupil whose needs required those skills entered a mainstream school in the local authority's area. To take the example I have already mentioned: before the five VI pupils now in Redbridge's mainstream schools, there had been no such pupils in Redbridge for 20 years.  </p>

He accepted during the course of submissions that if “inherent risk” were to be equated with “real as opposed to fanciful risk”, he would not take issue with the inherent risk formulation.

That test applied by Swift J derived from <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Refugee Legal Centre) v Secretary of State for</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">the home Department</span> [2005] 1 WLR 2219 (and<span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Tabbakh) v Staffordshire and</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">West Midlands Probation Trust)</span>. In both of those cases, as the judge recognised, the focus of the challenge was the fairness of the arrangements made and that explained why in each case the court's reasoning was formulated in terms of the language of fairness (i.e.. the essential question to be asked was whether the system of processing asylum seekers established by the policy under challenge was inherently unfair). There had to be a risk of unfairness inherent in the system itself rather than one arising in the ordinary course of individual decision-making. </p>

What matters in a systemic challenge of this kind is the need to distinguish between an inherent failure in the system challenged and individual examples of failings or unfairness which do not touch on that system’s integrity, however difficult it might be in practice to distinguish between those two situations: see to this effect <span style="text-decoration:underline">R (Woolcock) v Secretary of State for Communities and</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">Local Government</span> [2018] EWHC 17 (Admin), [2018] 4 WLR 49, Hickinbottom LJ at [68].

There is no evidence that the Redbridge arrangements entail waiting until a draft EHC plan is finalised before taking action in response to it (as Mr Bowen asserted); nor that Redbridge delays commencing an informal dialogue both with JCES and the school in question about fulfilling the requirements specified in the draft plan until such a plan is finalised.

ZK is entitled to rely on a systemic challenge and her case does not depend on any finding of an underlying specific breach. In any event, this judicial review was commenced before ZK’s transition to Oaks Park and that timing may explain the absence of any particular pleaded breach. Moreover her application to adduce fresh evidence made in advance of the hearing of this appeal would have addressed the question of individual breaches of section 42.

The discrimination claims comprised a claim that the arrangements Redbridge has in place amount to unjustified indirect discrimination against visually impaired pupils such as ZK (contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998 and Articles 14, 8 and/or Article 2 of Protocol I to the European Convention on Human Rights and/or sections 19 and 29(6) of the Equality Act 2010); and a claim that Redbridge’s decentralised arrangements are a failure to comply with the obligation to make reasonable adjustments  contrary to sections 20 and 21 and Schedule 2 of the Equality Act 2010. In relation to each claim, the disadvantages relied on are the same as those relied on to support the claim that the arrangements are irrational and/or unlawful but include the allegation that the decentralised model makes it less likely that ZK will be able to go to the school of her choice (which is not relevant to the legality claim). </p>

Neither side challenges that approach and I proceed on that basis. </p>

He rejected the contention that the Redbridge arrangements are an inherent source of disadvantage for the protected group in the sense that they bring with them the disadvantage relied on. He emphasised that although evidence of problems in individual cases where there have been complaints that what has been provided has not met the provision specified in the EHC plan could give rise to an inference of systemic failure, he was nonetheless satisfied that the arrangements in place with JCES for the provision of specialist support to pupils in mainstream schools do make sufficient allowance for the differences between pupils with special educational needs requiring the provision of specialist teaching assistance and other pupils. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In writing there are two challenges to this part of Swift J’s judgment, although neither was developed orally. First, there is a factual challenge to the conclusion that the decentralised model does not in fact disadvantage ZK and other pupils with severe visual impairment in the ways alleged. Reliance is placed on specific examples of gaps in the delivery of learning/educational content, general gaps in the training of teaching assistants and absences as demonstrating that ZK was disadvantaged because she was unable to follow the curriculum without appropriate specialist, appropriately trained support, at times missing school days and becoming distressed and depressed. Furthermore, she had no choice but to go to Oaks Park despite it being far from where she lives. Secondly, in writing reliance was placed on Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to contend that the judge was wrong to conclude that this provision took matters no further in this case. That was an error because Article 24 is highly material to the court’s assessment of the extent to which the decentralised model is discriminatory. So far as concerns the absence of any choice in relation to schools as a consequence of the decentralised model, reliance is placed on HK’s evidence that Oaks Park was in fact the only secondary school able to provide some of the specialist teaching assistant support required by ZK demonstrating that the Redbridge model creates a real risk that children with complex special educational needs will be forced to attend special schools because mainstream schools do not have the necessary specialist teaching assistant support in place to accommodate them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I have dealt above with the challenges advanced on behalf of ZK to the underlying factual findings made by the judge. True it is that there is a stark conflict in the evidence put forward on behalf of ZK about the way in which the Redbridge arrangements work in practice and the difficulties perceived on occasions with those arrangements, as compared with the evidence put forward on behalf of Redbridge. The judge made no findings of specific failings or breaches and was not invited to do so. This court cannot make such findings either. Rather as the judge made clear his focus was at a generic level on the extent to which, if at all, the disadvantages relied upon are inherent in the arrangements put in place by Redbridge. He was satisfied that they are not and that sufficient allowance for the differences between pupils with special educational needs requiring specialist trained teaching assistants and other pupils is made by the Redbridge arrangements. There was evidence to support those conclusions as I have explained above. He expressly addressed the contention that </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">ZK’s choice of school was narrowed by the arrangements put in place by Redbridge. He concluded that ZK’s ability to move to her choice of school was not affected by any matter inherent in the decentralised model, accepting the evidence of Joena Stanley as to the circumstances that led to Wanstead High School concluding that the school would not be able to accommodate ZK. On Redbridge’s account the problem was not the lack of suitably trained teaching assistants. Although none was in post a suitable teaching assistant could have been recruited and trained. The problem was rather the environmental audit as explained above. Moreover, in light of the evidence, again summarised above, the judge permissibly concluded that the decentralised model does not make mainstream schools less willing or able to accept a VI pupil. </p>

He held that purpose runs through to Redbridge’s decision on what services should be secured from JCES. </p>

Although accepting that compliance with this duty is a matter of substance not form, for ZK it is argued that Redbridge in fact failed to comply with the duty in substance and the judge did not refer to any evidential matters which would demonstrate such compliance. The focus on Redbridge’s purpose in making the challenged arrangements is not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the duty and in the absence of any finding that Redbridge had actual regard to the needs specified by section 149, the judge was wrong to find that Redbridge is operating its decentralised model in compliance with the requirements of that duty. </p>

Where, as here, the person concerned is ex-hypothesi disabled and the public authority is discharging its functions under statutes which expressly direct their attention to the needs of disabled persons, it may be entirely superfluous to make express reference to section 49A and absurd to infer from an omission to do so a failure on the authority's part to have regard to their general duty under the section. That, I am satisfied, is the position here. The question is one of substance, not of form. </p>

In other words, the nature of the duty to have due regard is informed by the particular function being exercised and not vice versa. In this case, Redbridge makes arrangements to discharge the duty imposed by section 42 of the 2014 Act expressly to secure special educational provision for pupils with special educational needs, including those with a disability. Accordingly I can see no error in the judge’s reliance in this regard, on the very purpose of the arrangements that Redbridge makes with JCES to ensure that the provision required to meet the assessed needs of visually impaired pupils in mainstream schools, as specified in EHC plans, is made. That was sufficient to meet the public sector equality duty in this case.  </p>
