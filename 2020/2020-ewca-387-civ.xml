It has been farmed by members of the Guest family for three generations.  Initially it was leased to the parents of the first appellant, David Guest, but when his father died in 1964 David and his mother bought it and farmed it in partnership until 1992.  David married the second appellant, Josephine, in 1964, and by 1992 Josephine was also a member of the farming partnership. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In 2017 Andrew brought these proceedings against David and Josephine, seeking a declaration of entitlement under the principles of proprietary estoppel to a beneficial interest in Tump Farm, together with a declaration of entitlement to reside in Granary Cottage.  After a trial spreading over some 6 court days in November and December 2018, HHJ Russen QC (sitting as a High Court Judge) (“the judge”) gave judgment in favour of Andrew and ordered David and Josephine to make a lump sum payment to Andrew composed of 50% after tax of the market value of the farming business, and 40% after tax of the market value of Tump Farm (subject to a life interest in favour of David and Josephine in the farmhouse).  It was the almost inevitable consequence of the judge’s order that Tump Farm would have to be sold in order to realise the lump sum payable to Andrew. </p>

Males LJ refused permission to appeal in respect of the existence of the equity, so the case comes before us solely on the question of remedy. </p>

The Farm comprises three dwelling houses (Tump Farmhouse, Granary Cottage and Stone Cottage), farm buildings, pasture land of around 150 acres, separated into two enclosures by a solar park of 32 acres which is leased to a commercial operator, and woodland of around 45 acres. There are now two telecoms masts on the Farm which are also leased to commercial operators. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Because the trial was intended to deal with both the existence of the equity, and, if established, the remedy to give effect to it, the judge had before him two joint valuation reports in respect of Tump Farm.   Mr McLaughlin of Carter Jonas valued the freehold of all the buildings and land (including the woodland and rental income from the solar park and telecoms masts) at £2,855,000 as at August 2018. Ms Dooley of Hazlewoods valued the Farm as an agricultural business at around £3.35m (the dairy farm business being attributed a value of just under £500,000). </p>

Each testator expressed the wish that Andrew and Ross should ultimately own the agricultural land and premises at Tump Farm "and any other agricultural premises owned wholly or in part by me at my death" and have the opportunity to continue the farming business.  The terms of this will were not communicated to Andrew at any time prior to the present proceedings. </p>

He paid his mother for board and lodging out of his wages. Andrew attended agricultural college for one day a week and spent the rest of it at the Farm.  After the summer of 1982, Andrew quickly took over sole responsibility for calf rearing, using the practical and management skills he was learning at college. In 1984 he took a course in artificial insemination of cattle.  Thereafter he took responsibility for the artificial insemination of cows and the selection of bulls and breeding cows.  After 1985 he undertook two further part-time courses of one year in farm enterprise management and whole farm management, and as a result took on more responsibility for the paperwork on the Farm, starting with straightforward cash analysis but progressing to greater financial management and administration, including managing farm subsidies and business planning. He attended any meetings which his father had with the partnership accountant or bank manager at which finances and business matters were discussed. </p>

In 1994, he was nominated as a Vice Chairman of the district branch of the Northern Milk Partnership.  Andrew dealt with a local consultant of the Milk Marketing Board who visited Tump Farm on a monthly basis, and was responsible for providing him with the input and output data which was then processed and translated into a performance indicator report for the benefit of the business. The reports indicated that the Farm's performance was average, at best.  Andrew succeeded in securing an additional 10% milk quota allocation (a further 65,000 litres).  Through the development of a business plan the business was lifted from its rating of "average" into the top 20%. This was in part the result of changes in feeding regime and in the feeds themselves, and of the cows being housed in a new building. Andrew also addressed the Farm's underperformance due to low stocking rates by deciding to breed more replacements.  </p>

His father made no secret of his intention to leave the Farm to the next generation.

Andrew responded by saying the suggested terms were neither acceptable nor formed the basis for negotiation. He said it would not be possible to operate a dairy business on the proposed 115 acres that would produce a turnover large enough to carry the current level of staff. His letter to Mr Pullin of 3 March 2015 concluded with his looking forward to "receiving a more realistic proposal in due course".

At [44] he noted the wide range of variation in the main elements of the doctrine: that is, the quality of the assurances which give rise to the claimant’s expectations and the extent of the claimant’s detrimental reliance on those assurances.  He went on to distinguish between those cases where “both the claimant’s expectations and the element of detriment will have been defined with reasonable clarity”, and those where “the claimant’s expectations are uncertain” or “the court … is not satisfied that the high level of the claimant’s expectations is fairly derived from his deceased patron’s assurances, which may have justified only a lower level of expectation”.  In the former class of case the court was likely to vindicate the claimant’s expectation, because there is something approaching a bargain and the claimant will have performed his side of it.  In the latter class of case the court might still take the expectation as a starting point, but no more than that. At [50] to [52] he said: </p>

To recapitulate: there is a category of case in which the benefactor and the claimant have reached a mutual understanding which is in reasonably clear terms but does not amount to a contract.  I have already referred to the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor’s house, either outright or for life.  In such a case the court’s natural response is to fulfil the claimant’s expectations.  But if the claimant’s expectations are uncertain, or extravagant, or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered, the court can and should recognise that the claimant’s equity should be satisfied in another (and generally more limited) way. </p>

Indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify, in financial terms, than the claimant’s expectations.  Detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person’s house, and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Snell’s Equity</span> 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed para 39-21 and the authorities mentioned in that paragraph).  But the detriment of an ever-increasing burden of care for an elderly person, and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes, is very difficult to quantify in money terms.  Moreover the claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor’s assurances, and may receive some countervailing benefits (such as free bed and board).  In such circumstances the court has to exercise a wide judgmental discretion.   </p>

To these can safely be added the court’s recognition that it cannot compel people who have fallen out to live peaceably together, so that there may be a need for a clean break; alterations in the benefactor’s assets and circumstances, especially where the benefactor’s assurances have been given, and the claimant’s detriment has been suffered, over a long period of years; the likely effect of taxation; and (to a limited degree) the other claims (legal or moral) on the benefactor or his or her estate.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge commenced the conclusory section of his judgment by explaining the nature of the relationship between Andrew and his parents, and in particular the relationship Andrew had with his father.  Both were strong-willed characters.  They had widely differing approaches, David’s being traditional and cautious, Andrew’s less risk averse.  Through his training Andrew felt that it was necessary to make substantial capital commitments funded by borrowing.  David’s attitude to risk could be seen from his reluctance to advance succession arrangements for fear of some unforeseen marital strife involving either of his sons. David and his father had a communication problem. This accounted in large part for the breakdown of relations, but was also very significant when it came to assessing whether or not there was a “clear enough” assurance that Andrew would inherit the Farm or some interest in it.   The judge no doubt had in mind his earlier discussion of <span style="font-style:italic">Thorner v Major </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Gillett v Holt</span>.  He said at [137]: </p>

Although the assurances were specific enough in identifying the farm, and until the late 1990's Andrew alone was assumed within the family to be the successor to the business, the extent of Andrew's promised inheritance was left open. Nevertheless, it was to be a significant share in the farm, as is evident from the family's expectation (after 1997) that Andrew and Ross would farm side-by-side.  </p>

He treated this in a straightforward, broad-brush way, not applying mathematical precision.  He concluded that it was obvious that Andrew reasonably relied on David’s assurance.  This could be seen from the fact that Andrew worked hard on the Farm for many years for little financial reward, even taking into account the provision of accommodation at Granary Cottage and the payment of certain living expenses. He would not have done so if David had not encouraged the idea of an inheritance.  There were limits, however, to the extent to which one could explore the counter-factual position premised on an assumption that Andrew had gone to work elsewhere.  The judge expressed himself as satisfied that Andrew was “a hard-working, accomplished and forward-thinking farmer”.  His current position as a herdsman, starting afresh in his fifties, provided no real indication of what he could have achieved starting in his 20s, 30s and 40s.  </p>

A significant part of the cross-examination of Andrew had been taken up with the suggestion that the breakdown in relations was Andrew’s fault.  The judge rejected the suggestion that those matters had an adverse impact on the claim.  The partnership came very late in the chronology, and the judge felt unable to say that Andrew’s position was wrong.  The same applied to the suggestion that Andrew should not have rejected the offer of a FBT at a discounted rent.  This did not address Andrew’s “proprietary expectation”.  </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“In my judgment, therefore, the court should approach the question of remedy by looking first at the claimant's expectation based upon the nature of the assurance made to him. Before contemplating the grant of a remedy which would satisfy that expectation it should first check that doing so would not produce one out of proper proportion to the value of the detriment suffered by the claimant. That is the eighth proposition in Davies. But identifying the true measure of "the equity" to be satisfied may not stop there. The ninth proposition refers to the principled exercise of "the broad judgmental discretion" and it is clear from what Robert Walker LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings v Rice</span>, at [49], that satisfying the equity may well not involve satisfying the claimant's expectation for other reasons that might support the conclusion that, in the circumstances, it is too extravagant. Together with the fifth one, that last proposition encompasses the notion that the court must also do justice to the defendant. That may involve taking account of the defendant's continuing interest in the property (particularly when the claimant's expectation was to inherit only after his death) and the interests of others, aside from the claimant, whose occupation may derive from that interest or who may have their own claims or expectations in relation to it.” </p>

Next, he reminded himself that the assurance was as to an inheritance after the second death of David and Josephine “who might expect to live for many years yet, in their home at Tump Farm”. Even though Andrew expected to take on the farming business (and thought he effectively had in 2012) he did not expect to acquire any interest in the land and buildings before his father’s death.  The determination that the judge was required to perform had to be performed now, during the parents’ lifetime, but that involved an acceleration of his entitlement.

The bystander would not therefore expect David and Josephine to have intended an arrangement in which they were committed to passing on to Andrew any such interest.  In such circumstances, the court will regard the extent of the equity as limited to undoing what has taken place.  This might take the form of depriving the owner of the benefit that he has derived from the other party’s reliance on such assurance as he has made, or awarding compensation for the detriment the other party has suffered.  It was, however, wrong in principle for the judge to have started from Andrew’s subjective expectation when it was not founded on any sufficiently definite promise. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Crabb</span>, the defendants had encouraged the plaintiff, their neighbour, to believe that the plaintiff would have access from his land onto the defendants’ land to reach the highway though a particular access point on their common boundary.  In reliance on that encouragement, the plaintiff then sold part of his land without reserving to himself an alternative route across that part to the highway.  The defendants then fenced off the access point, leaving the plaintiff’s retained land without any access at all.  Lord Denning MR, giving the first judgment, considered whether an equity arose, and then proceeded to ask “in what way now should the equity be satisfied”.  Under this head he considered that “equity is displayed at its most flexible”, and decided that the equity should be satisfied by the grant of an easement, without payment.    Lawton LJ approached the matter on the same basis.  Neither judge adopted an intermediate stage of asking what the extent of the equity was.  Lord Denning and Lawton LJ agreed that the court should declare that the plaintiff was entitled to an easement, without payment.  Scarman LJ agreed that the appeal should be allowed but gave his own reasons.   Having decided that an equity arose he went on to “the other two questions – the extent of the equity and the relief necessary to satisfy it”.  It appears from page 198 at G-H that he considered that the second question, the extent of the equity, was concerned with finding “the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff”.  This he held to be “an easement or a licence upon terms to be agreed”.  Under the third question, what was necessary to satisfy the equity, he considered whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to pay for the easement or licence.  He held that in all the circumstances it was not necessary for there to be payment. </p>

One could instead have asked a single question: what is necessary to avoid an unconscionable result?  The answer would be that provided by all members of the court, namely an assured, payment-free right of access across the defendants’ land.  </p>

Mr Adams submits that the extent of the remedy is what an objective bystander would say is the arrangement that the owner must be taken to have intended in order to avoid an unconscionable result.   I think this injects an unnecessary layer of complication into the established approach.  The objective of the remedy is certainly to avoid a result which is unconscionable.  An unconscionable result would normally appear to be so to an objective bystander, at least if he or she is a reasonable one.  To that extent, the courts have sometimes used a normative legal fiction in order to determine what is and what is not unconscionable (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Uglow v Uglow</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 987 at [30] per Mummery LJ).  The bystander, however, takes into account all the circumstances, including the expectations of and detriment to the claimant.  He does not look at the matter solely through the eyes of the owner.  Mr Adams’ test, which asks what the bystander would have thought the owner to have intended to avoid an unconscionable result risks skewing the exercise in a manner not supported by authority.   </p>

That was essentially because no clear enough assurance had been given to Andrew.  The objective bystander would not therefore have thought it unconscionable if David and Josephine had, by way of example, sold the Farm and gone on a world cruise and spending spree, and left whatever remained of the estate to the children in equal shares.  If that was so, the minimum award necessary to do justice fell well short of what the judge had awarded here.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with this submission is that it cuts right across the judge’s findings in relation to the components of the proprietary estoppel.  The judge found that a sufficiently clear assurance had been given to Andrew that he would inherit a sufficient interest in Tump Farm to enable him to farm there.  That assurance had been intended to be, and was, acted upon.  As a result, Andrew had given up the possibility of being able to pursue a successful career elsewhere.  The assurances had been relied upon, in one form or another, for over 30 years, the best years of Andrew’s life. Andrew had received little financial return.  Finally, the judge held that, by repudiating that assurance and effectively disinheriting Andrew, David and Josephine had acted unconscionably.  In those circumstances I am unable to accept the premise of Mr Adams’ argument, that to sell the Farm and dissipate the assets is something that the objective bystander would not regard as unconscionable.  If it was unconscionable to repudiate the promise, it would equally be so to place oneself in the position where the promise becomes impossible to perform. </p>

I take first the suggestion that Andrew should be compensated by a sum representing the extent to which the value of the Farm has increased as a result of Andrew’s contribution.  Mr Adams submitted that this would be a fair way of compensating Andrew, given that his “real complaint” was that his efforts on the Farm had not been properly appreciated or rewarded. </p>

First, it pays no regard to the nature of the assurance which he was given.  This was not that his efforts and dedication would be generously rewarded in the event that they bore fruit, by reference to any increase in the value of the land. Rather it was that he would inherit a sufficient interest in the Farm to enable him to farm himself.  The remedy must be fashioned paying proper regard to the nature of the assurances given.  Secondly, the proposed remedy focuses attention entirely on what David and Josephine have gained as a result of promising something to Andrew which they did not subsequently deliver.  That seems to me to be a remedy which is completely out of kilter with the nature of the cause of action.  The remedy proposed would be more appropriate to an action in unjust enrichment, which this is not.  Quite apart from these objections, the proposed remedy would require a factual enquiry which was not undertaken at the trial (because it had not been suggested).  There is no way for us to know what the proposed method of calculating compensation would be or what it would yield.  In those circumstances it is not possible to decide whether it would avoid an unconscionable result. </p>

The loss or detriment suffered by a claimant who is persuaded to take a poorly remunerated position on the strength of a promise of some interest in land is not limited to the quantifiable difference in wages.  There is a large but unquantifiable element attributable to loss of opportunity which will, in many cases, make it just to award sums far greater than any sum based on the wage differential.   In a case where the claimant has largely performed his side of the bargain, it is fair to take what the claimant was promised as a rough proxy for what he has lost.

First, while such a course is no doubt a possibility, Mr Adams did not submit that it is not open in principle for a judge to accelerate the claimant’s entitlement in a proprietary estoppel case based on assurance of inheritance.  It is therefore necessary for him to show that the judge exceeded the wide bounds of his discretion by adopting the course of settling Andrew’s entitlement now.  Secondly, the judge had to balance a number of factors in deciding what course to take.  This was a case where there was no prospect of the parties continuing to work and live together in close proximity.  Deferral would perpetuate the situation in which Andrew was required to take up salaried employment away from the Farm, for an indefinite period. Andrew had expected to take over running the Farm on his father’s retirement, yet did not expect to inherit anything until his parents’ deaths. An immediate sale would prejudice David and Josephine in some ways, although it would release capital to fund their retirements. That was the background against which the judge decided to accelerate Andrew’s entitlement, whilst at the same time making allowance for a life interest in the farmhouse for the parents and mitigating the tax impact of paying Andrew’s entitlement now.

Their consistent wish, through the 1981 wills and the 2012 partnership arrangements was that Andrew and Ross would continue to farm Tump Farm.  I do not accept this.  First, the submission is based, at least to some extent, on the earlier contention that the award necessary to avoid an unconscionable result is to be arrived at by enquiring what the owners must have intended.  I have rejected that contention.  Secondly, if decisive weight is given to the fact that farmers would not wish to sell a farm, a cleanbreak solution would hardly ever be possible.  Yet it is clear from the cases (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Jennings v Rice</span> at [52]) that a clean-break solution is indeed possible, and has been found necessary in a number of farm cases (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Moore v Moore</span> [2018] EWCA Civ. 2669).   The judge did not go wrong in principle by devising a clean break solution in the present case.

There is no reason whatever to believe that Andrew would have remained on the Farm, or dedicated his life to it if, instead of giving the assurances which he did, David had merely promised Andrew that he would one day become a tenant farmer at a discounted rent.  Insofar as the point relates to Andrew’s conduct, in that  he ought reasonably to have accepted the FBT that he was offered, that contention is hopeless.  As Arnold LJ pointed out in the course of argument, the FBT offered was for a fixed term, and with no guarantee of renewal.  Against the background of the assurances that he had been given, he was right not to accept it. </p>
