	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">This is the judgment of the court on the appeal of Mr Kevin Cowley (“the Appellant”) from the order of 14 November 2018 of HH Judge Rawlings sitting in the County Court at Stoke-on-Trent. By his order the judge dismissed the Appellant’s appeal from the order of 31 May 2018 of District Judge Etherington striking out the Appellant’s claim against L.W. Carlisle Limited (“LWC”), the party named as the Third Defendant in the proceedings. The judge also ordered the Appellant to pay the Third Defendant’s costs of the appeal (not to be enforced without the permission of the court), summarily assessed at £4,200 (inclusive of VAT). Permission to appeal to this court was granted by Irwin LJ by his order of 5 November 2019. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">The proceedings involve a claim by the Appellant for damages for noise induced hearing loss alleged to have been sustained by him in the course of his employment, by four different employer companies, between 1963 and 2000. The claim in total is said to be in the region of £5000 in value. It is most disturbing, therefore, to note first, the figure for costs appearing in the judge’s order under appeal and secondly, to see that the Costs Schedules delivered for this present appeal (from what were merely the interim orders below involving only one of four defendants) claim sums of £19,367.52 and £23,420,16 respectively. The costs expended on this satellite litigation, therefore, stand at a little less than £50,000 in relation to just one defendant to a claim worth only £5,000. We return to that matter at the end of this judgment. </p>

LWC had been struck off the register of companies and was dissolved on dates unknown to us. That was the position, known to the Appellant’s solicitors, when the proceedings were issued and at all stages of the proceedings in the court below. The issues before us all arise from the fact of LWC’s dissolution before the issue of the proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">According to a chronology produced by the Appellant’s solicitors for this appeal, on 25 June 2018, i.e. after the District Judge’s order but before either of the two hearings before Judge Rawlings concerning the appeal to him, application had been made to the High Court on behalf of the Appellant for an order restoring LWC to the Register. It does not appear from the transcript of the appeal hearing before Judge Rawlings, which was produced to us, that the judge was informed of that fact. Mr Hughes who appeared before the judge, as he does before us, confirmed that the judge was not so told.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">What the Appellant’s solicitors’ new chronology in our bundles did not reveal, however, was that, on 5 February 2019, in the High Court at Manchester, it had been ordered that LWC be restored to the Register of Companies. This court was informed of that fact for the first time at the hearing of the appeal. There was no hint of this in any part of the two files or other papers lodged for the appeal. The information appears only to have emerged when (on the day before the appeal) the court enquired of Mr Hughes as to the source of his instructing solicitors’ authority to act for LWC, given that the company appeared no longer to be in existence. </p>

On 13 December 2017, according to a “certificate of service”, the Appellant’s solicitors posted the claim form, together with supporting documents, and a response pack, by way of purported service, to the then non-existent LWC at an address at Newlands Street, Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, identified as its “last known place of business”.  </p>

He was entitled to take a robust attitude to a failure by the Appellants to take the steps that were necessary in order to allow the proceedings to proceed. It is remarkable not so much that the Appellants had not made an application to restore the Company to register before the application to strike out the claim was served upon his solicitors but that, in the month after the application was issued and served applying to strike out the claim on the basis that  the Company had not been restored, that not only had the Appellants not taken any steps towards the restoration of the Company but that there was no evidence before the Court that they had any intention of doing so or, if they had such an intention, when the  application would be made.

There was no company in existence to give them authority to act. If authority was thought to have been given by any provision of an insurance policy effected by LWC in the past, it seems such an authority to the Insurers to act as agents for the company may well have lapsed along with its dissolution, just as any agent’s authority would lapse on the death of the principal.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">First, what is to be done in the difficult position facing insurance companies in the circumstances such as those facing these Insurers when they heard of the claim in 2017? An order restoring a company to the register might render insurers retrospectively liable for significant sums in proceedings which they have been in no position to resist. Without being prescriptive, we think that the wise course would be for such an insurer to notify the claimant of the dissolution of the company (if he or she did not know of it already) and to invite/require him or her to make an application for restoration of the company to the register and to apply to the court seised of the main claim for a stay of the substantive proceedings in the interim. In the absence of co-operation in this respect on the part of the claimant, the insurer should write to the court notifying it of the situation and asking it to consider making an order for a stay of its own motion until notified of any order for restoration. Following such a stay, if nothing is done after a sensible time, it would (we think) be open to the insurer to invite the court (of its own motion) to strike out the proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in">As for the costs of the present proceedings and whatever order is ultimately made between the parties or against legal representatives, there appears to us (on present information) good reason to think that the Appellant’s solicitors should not expect the Appellant personally to bear any of the costs of any party of the proceedings (including his own costs) in this court or in the County Court at either level. Those costs were occasioned essentially by the misguided commencement of proceedings by the solicitors against LWC at a time when it was known that that company had been dissolved and was not in existence and without taking prompt steps to pursue the restoration of the company to the register. </p>
