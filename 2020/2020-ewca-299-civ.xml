	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal from the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) contains all the classic ingredients that make up the daily fare of the successful tax law specialist.  First, it requires the untangling of interrelated statutory provisions, amended several times over the years and supplemented by statutory instruments, also amended.  Secondly, the answer may ultimately lie, at least according to one of the parties, in what is meant by one or two perfectly ordinary English words found in one of those statutory provisions.  Thirdly, an eye-wateringly large amount of tax is either due or not due depending on which of the two contending constructions is correct.  In this appeal the Respondents’ entitlement to losses of about £675 million turns on the result and there is more at stake because of other cases which we are told are waiting in the wings for our decision in this case.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The dispute concerns each of the Respondents’ entitlement to set off foreign exchange losses against their liability to corporation tax. The exchanges loss arose as a result of the Respondent companies changing their functional accounting currencies from sterling to US dollars on 23 December 2008 at a time when the only asset on their balance sheets was a very substantial inter-company debt owed to them by their parent company.  The debts were denominated in sterling but then had to be converted into dollars when the companies’ accounts were restated in dollars. The next day, the debts were disposed of as part of a group restructuring.  The exchange losses arose from the Respondents’ ‘loan relationships’ as that term is used in Chapter 2 of Part IV of the Finance Act 1996 (‘Chapter 2’).  All section numbers in this judgment refer to sections in that Act unless otherwise stated.  I will need to examine the relevant provisions in more detail later but it is useful here to summarise the scheme set out in the Act as it applies to the exchange losses for which the Respondents claim relief from corporation tax in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 80 provides that all profits and gains arising to a company from its loan relationships should be chargeable to tax as income in accordance with Chapter 2. It provides also that the Chapter has effect for the purpose of determining how any deficit on a company’s loan relationships is to be brought into account. Section 81 defines ‘loan relationship’ for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts. A loan relationship exists whenever a company stands in the position of a creditor or debtor as respects any money debt and that debt is one arising from a transaction for lending money. Section 82 sets out the method for bringing into account any gains or deficits arising from the company’s loan relationships and provides that those gains and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 84 then provides for what debits and credits are to be brought into account in respect of the company’s loan relationships. It provides that the credits and debits to be brought into account shall be the sums which when taken together ‘fairly represent’ all profits, gains and losses of the company arising from its loan relationships.  As originally enacted, section 84 did not cover gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates as they affected a company’s loan relationships. The Finance Act 2002 introduced section 84A to deal with exchange gains and losses arising from loan relationships. Section 84A provides, broadly, that exchange gains and losses are included in the references in section 84 to profits, gains and losses arising from its loan relationships. The term ‘exchange gains and losses’ is defined by section 103(1A), which was also introduced by the Finance Act 2002.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 84A(3), however, excepted certain exchange gains and losses so that they were not included in the credits and debits covered by section 84.  The category of exchange gains or losses to which section 84A does not apply because of section 84A(3) include those which fall within either section 84A(3)(a) or (b) and which are recognised in the company’s statement of total recognised gains and losses (‘STRGL’), rather than in its profit and loss account. Section 84A conferred on HM Treasury a regulation-making power to bring into account in prescribed circumstances amounts which are taken out of the regime by section 84A(3).  HM Treasury exercised that power in 2002 making regulations which covered, amongst other things, the disposal of loan relationships in respect of which exchange gains and losses have been recognised in the company’s STRGL. </p>

Each of them was a subsidiary of Smith &amp; Nephew Investment Holdings Ltd (‘S&amp;N Holdings’) which is another UK company.  As at 23 December 2008, each of the Respondents was entitled to an inter-company receivable (‘ICR’) owed to them by their parent, S&amp;N Holdings. Smith &amp; Nephew Overseas Ltd (‘Overseas’) was owed an inter-company receivable of about £1.63 billion; TP Ltd (‘TP’) was owed an intercompany receivable of about £524 million; and Smith &amp; Nephew Finance Holdings Limited (‘S&amp;N Finance’) was owed about £340 million. Although the ICRs were non-interest-bearing, their existence meant that the Respondents, which were otherwise dormant, had to prepare annual tax returns reporting notional interest income arising on the ICRs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In December 2008 the UK trading group was restructured. The way in which the restructuring was carried out is relevant to the question of whether there was some ‘real world effect’ of the exchange rate losses on the finances of the group.  Dealing first with the treatment of TP, there was a share purchase agreement entered into on 23 December 2008 under which Smith &amp; Nephew plc agreed to buy from S&amp;N Holdings all the share capital of Overseas and TP.  The price that Smith &amp; Nephew plc would pay S&amp;N Holdings was £1.69 billion for Overseas and £500,000 million for TP. This consideration was expressed to be payable on completion in cash. However, TP did not stay for long as a subsidiary of Smith &amp; Nephew plc because by an agreement dated 24 December 2008, Smith &amp; Nephew plc agreed to sell its new subsidiary TP to Overseas (by then also a subsidiary of Smith &amp; Nephew plc).  Overseas agreed to pay Smith &amp; Nephew plc $3.5 billion for the shares in TP.  That $3.5 billion was payable by Overseas to Smith &amp; Nephew plc partly in cash (as to about $2.4 billion) and partly by the issue and allotment by Overseas to Smith &amp; Nephew plc of one ordinary share in Overseas at a premium equal to the balance of the consideration (that is about $1.05 billion). The effect of the restructuring on TP was that TP became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Overseas; the amount of the premium allocated to the share in Overseas was transferred to the share premium account of Overseas (or more accurately the group reconstruction account since this was an intra-group transaction) and the net inter-company receivable held by Overseas was reduced to $200,000. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">TP also made an acquisition as part of the restructuring. Smith &amp; Nephew plc owned a different subsidiary called Smith &amp; Nephew USD Limited (‘USD’). By a further agreement dated 24 December 2008, TP agreed to buy the entire share capital of USD from Smith &amp; Nephew plc for $3.5 billion. This was required to be satisfied partly in cash (in the amount of about $772 million) and partly by the issue and allotment to Smith &amp; Nephew plc of one ordinary share in TP at a premium equal to the balance of the consideration, that is about $2.7 billion. USD therefore became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TP, the amount of the premium allocated to the share owned by Smith &amp; Nephew plc in TP was transferred to the share premium account of TP and the intercompany receivable in TP was eliminated. </p>

Since the functional currency of Smith &amp; Nephew plc was dollars, there was a change on 23 December 2008 in the functional currency of each of the three Respondents from sterling to US dollars for accountancy purposes. On that day, once the functional currency was changed to US dollars, each Respondent still held the ICR in its accounts denominated in sterling, albeit for only one day until the transfer agreements </p>

Accounting standards required them also to restate the previous year’s accounts in dollars. A note to each of the companies’ accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 explained the effect of what had happened. Taking TP as an example, the sterling value of the intercompany receivable of course remained constant between 1 January 2007 and 23 December 2008 at £524,242,838.  The value of that amount in dollars at the exchange rate on 31 December 2007 was higher than it had been at the exchange rate on 1 January 2007. Comparing those two figures, there was an exchange gain over the year 2007.  But this gain was more than cancelled out by the weakening of sterling against the dollar over the course of 2008.  The intercompany receivable expressed in dollars as at 23 December 2008 was worth substantially less than it had been worth at the start of the year. This created an exchange loss which, when netted off against the small exchange gain over the course of 2007, generated an aggregated exchange loss of $253,576,261.

The effect of it is that where the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the company’s STRGL rather than in its profit and loss account, they do not come into account in each tax year in which they are so recognised but the aggregate of the gains and losses recognised over the years is brought into account in the year in which the loan relationship is disposed of.  It may at first sight seem strange that regulation 13(2) was not repealed in 2004 when paragraph (2A) was introduced since section 84A(4) to which paragraph (2) refers was repealed at that time. However both Mr Ghosh and Mr Gibbon agreed that regulation 13(2) would still be relevant to the recognition of exchange rate losses and gains in accounting periods occurring before the repeal of section 84A(4) took effect. Although that subsection is repealed, those figures are still to be taken into account in the aggregation exercise required by regulation 13(4).  </p>

It concerned the transfer of claims that the taxpayer had against certain insolvent companies. Those claims were valuable in the sense that they were likely to result in a substantial payment at some point in the future and for that reason they had a market valuation of £200 million. In accordance with GAAP, however, the claims properly carried a value of nil in the taxpayer’s accounts. The taxpayer wished to avoid the situation in which it would be liable to corporation tax on the full amount of the sums received as and when the claims were paid out.  It sought to achieve this by transferring the claims to a Jersey subsidiary and acquiring in return the shares in that subsidiary. The intention was that the shares in the subsidiary would still carry a value of nil in the taxpayer’s accounts but the base value of the claims in the hands of the subsidiary would be their market value of about £200 million. If the claims subsequently paid out more than that, any profit would be attributed to the taxpayer and taxed in the UK accordingly. But only profits arising from realisation of the claims in excess of the £200 million base value would be brought home to the UK and taxed in the hands of the taxpayer. The overall effect of the scheme if it worked was </p>

	    <p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">that the £200 million would remain in Jersey and fall permanently outside the net of corporation tax. The claims were ultimately realised for £243 million.  The claims were loan relationships with the meaning of Chapter 2. HMRC accepted that the taxpayer’s accounts complied with GAAP but concluded that a credit of £43 million did not fairly represent the profit arising to the taxpayer from the loan relationship. They therefore amended the tax returns on the footing that £200 million of profit should be recognised as having been received by the taxpayer when it transferred the claims to the Jersey subsidiary.   </p>

The Court of Appeal held that it did and that looking at the matter in the round there was no difficulty in concluding that a profit or gain arose to the taxpayer from the disposal of the claims. Such profit or gain could only be fairly represented by a credit in the hands of the taxpayer equal to the value of the claim at the date of the disposal. In that way the profit or gain was brought into charge to tax at the same value as was recognised for accounting purposes in the hands of the subsidiary. There was therefore a symmetrical outcome as between the two counterparties to the transfer of the claims.  Conversely, if the base value of the claims in the accounts of the subsidiary were treated as £200 million (so that only the excess realised over that was taxed in the hand of the taxpayer) but the value of the shares acquired by the taxpayer was treated as nil, there was an asymmetry which did not fairly represent the outcome in the taxpayer’s hands even though it was compliant with GAAP. </p>

That was a puzzling amendment given that the introductory words of section 85A(1) as inserted in 2004 already stated that the provision was subject to the provisions of Chapter 2. Why did Parliament think it appropriate to single out section 84(1) as a provision of Chapter 2 to which the computation rule in section 85A(1) was subject? That amendment, he said, was intended: (para. 43) </p>

The enquiry under section 84(1), in its post-2004 form, is different from, and wider than, the link with UK GAAP mandated by section 85A(1), in at least two respects. First, section 84(1) requires regard to be had to any related transactions as well as to the relevant loan relationship itself. … Secondly, the requirement to “fairly represent” the profits, gains and losses arising to the company will not necessarily be answered by saying that they are recognised in accordance with  UK GAAP, because section 84(1) would then add nothing of substance to section 85A(1) and there would be no point in making the latter provision expressly subject to the former.” </p>

In my judgment the parties were right to avoid that kind of an analysis and to focus instead on the wording of the statutory provisions, on whether the ‘fairly represent’ test applies at all and if so what it means.  I agree with HMRC’s submission that the presence or absence of a tax avoidance purpose should not be determinative. Although the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">GDF Suez</span> explained how the amendments to the loan relationships regime in 2004 and 2006 were prompted by the desire to close loopholes and prevent tax avoidance, the wording of the statute does not refer to tax avoidance as a yardstick. It is not correct to give the ‘fairly represent’ test a limited meaning by regarding tax avoidance as the paradigm situation where the test would not be met.  The test may well be failed in a case where there is an avoidance motive but where the more specific provisions directed at preventing avoidance do not, for whatever reason, apply.  However, the override is not limited to that situation since it is intended to operate in favour of the taxpayer as well as in favour of HMRC. It may lead, for example, to profits being left out of account for tax purposes even though they are included in the company’s accounts in accordance with GAAP. I also agree that the presence or absence of an ‘asymmetry’ of the tax treatment of a transaction when looked at from the perspective of the counterparties is not a factor that need be present in every case where the override is triggered.  It so happens that asymmetry was a factor both in <span style="font-style:italic">GDF Suez </span>and in the earlier case of <span style="font-style:italic">DCC Holdings (UK) Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners </span>[2010] UKSC 58, [2011] 1 WLR 44.  That does not mean, in my view, that the absence of an asymmetry in any subsequent case militates against the override being triggered.  Finally, I agree with Mr Gibbon that the hurdle of ‘manifest absurdity’ which the Upper Tribunal appears to have applied before triggering the ‘fairly represent’ override is too stringent a test.  The true analysis is that section 84(1) is engaged wherever fair representation would not otherwise be achieved.   </p>

The first point that HMRC emphasised was that on the facts of this case there had been no real exchange rate exposure because of the hedging arrangements entered into by the Smith &amp; Nephew group.  The second point relied on by HMRC was that the losses were in substance presentational, intra-group losses which disappeared once the accounts of the different entities were consolidated in the group’s accounts.  HMRC submitted that these points meant that even the financial consequences relied on by the Respondents as comprising the real world impact of currency fluctuation should be disregarded.  Mr Gibbon was right in my judgment to put these points to one side when making his oral submissions.  The hedging arrangements entered into were designed to protect the Respondents’ exposure to foreign exchange rate for the one day - 24 December 2008 - on which they held sterling denominated debt but had accounts expressed in US dollars. The exchange losses arose because of fluctuations in exchange rates between 1 January 2007 and 23 December 2008.  The two exchange exposures are unrelated since they are dealing with two different time periods.  As to the second point, if Parliament had wanted to exclude intragroup loans from the loan relationships regime it could easily have done so.

Here the exchange loss arises only as a result of the restatement of the Respondents’ accounts into dollars on the change of their functional currency. The actual ICR was always a sterling debt and was paid off in sterling during the course of the series of restructuring transactions.

I explain these points in more detail later. Most of Mr Ghosh’s submissions related, however, to the two issues raised in the Respondents’ Notice served in June 2019. Those issues logically precede the question of whether the exchange losses ‘fairly represent’ their profits, gains and losses because they seek to establish that the ‘fairly represent’ test does not apply in this context at all or at least not in the way that HMRC contend.  They argue that the exchange losses in this case are only brought into the regime at all by regulation 13 of the 2002 Regulations.  That regulation provides simply that the exchange losses falling within its scope shall be brought into account. There is no need to pass them through the prism of section 84(1)(a) and the ‘fairly represent’ test at all; that test has no application to these losses.  Alternatively, they submit that HMRC is asking the wrong question in examining whether the exchange losses ‘fairly represent’ the profits, gains and losses of the company.  The question mandated by the way in which section 84A(1) interpolates exchange losses into section 84(1)(a) is whether the debits which the Respondents are seeking to bring into account fairly represent the exchange losses arising to them from their loan relationships. The answer to that question is clearly ‘yes’ since the debits exactly are the exchange losses.  The inquiry should stop there and there is no need to explore what the effect on the affairs of the companies or the group of the exchange losses was in the ‘real world’ - whatever that means. </p>

Generally speaking, exchange gains and losses arising from loan relationships are brought into section 84(1)(a) through section 84A(1). Precisely how they are brought in is the subject of a further argument by the Respondents discussed later.  Where an exchange loss arises in relation to an asset or liability representing a loan relationship of the company and it is recognised in the company’s STRGL, subsection (1) of section 84A does not apply because of section 84A(3).  Subsection (8) of section 84A empowers HM Treasury to make regulations ‘for or in connection with bringing into account in prescribed circumstances’ amounts which are carved out of subsection (1) by subsection (3).  It provides in subsection (9) that the Treasury can do this in one of two ways, either (a) by bringing them into account for the purposes of Chapter 2 as credits or debits in respect of the company’s loan relationships or alternatively (b) by bringing them into the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 regime. </p>

Regulation 13 sets out two different circumstances which are prescribed for the purposes of section 84A(8). Both circumstances involve where there has been a disposal of an asset which represents a loan relationship.  The second circumstance described in paragraph (2A) is the one that applies here, namely where there has been a disposal of an asset representing a loan relationship in relation to which exchange gains or losses were recognised in the company’s STRGL.

That occurs by operation of the wording of regulation 13 which provides that the aggregated amount ‘shall be brought into account’ as a credit or debit.  There is nothing in regulation 13 that leads one back to section 84A(1) or section 84(1)(a).

It would, Mr Gibbon submitted, be incoherent for Parliament to have intended to permit this class of exchange gains and losses to bypass the governing concept of fair representation provided for in section 84(1). On the contrary, the overall coherence of the Chapter 2 scheme requires section 84(1) to be the pivot by which the accounting, GAAP world, moves over to the tax world. The aggregated amount arrived at on the application of regulation 13 can still be treated as a credit or debit to be brought into account if but only if it fairly represents for the accounting period in which the loan relationship was disposed of all profits, gains and losses of the company in accordance with section 84(1)(a). </p>

It has never been HMRC’s case that the Respondents’ exchange losses fall outside the regime entirely. Section 84A(3) prevents the exchange losses falling within section 84A(1).  The only way they can be brought within the regime is through the exercise of the power in section 84A(8).  The power in section 84A(8) is to make regulations ‘for or in connection with bringing into account’ amounts in prescribed circumstances.  That power is clearly not limited to a power to disapply section 84A(3) in prescribed circumstances – the regulations may directly bring amounts into account and, indeed, may do so either for the purposes of Chapter 2 or for the purposes of the capital gains tax regime.  The wording of regulation 13 shows that the Treasury in exercising the power chose to bring the exchange gains and losses into the loan relationships regime and so subject them to corporation tax rather than capital gains tax. In my judgment the wording of regulation 13(3) stipulates that the amount computed in accordance with the regulation “shall be brought into account”. By stipulating that, the regulation did not stray outside the scope of the power conferred by section 84A(8) because that provision empowered HM Treasury to made regulations <span style="font-style:italic">for bringing amounts into account</span> as well as conferring a power to make regulations <span style="font-style:italic">in connection with bringing amounts into account</span>.

They submit that the purposes of Chapter 2 include the purpose of applying the ‘fairly represent’ test in section 84(1).  I do not agree that those words can bear the weight that HMRC place on them.  The words are intended to do two things.  First to show that HM Treasury has chosen the corporation tax rather than the capital gains tax regime for bringing these amounts into tax.  Secondly they show that although the net gain or net loss is brought into account, the relevance of that is limited to the application of the provisions in Chapter 2.  In other words the net gain or loss is not to be treated as part of the company’s account for the purpose of any other aspect of corporation tax or for the purposes of applying any tax other than corporation tax. If therefore in some other statutory provisions a question arises whether the company has achieved a net gain or suffered a net loss arising out of the loan relationship, neither the taxpayer nor HMRC can point to regulation 13 to say that the amount has been brought into its account for that other purpose. It is brought into the account for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of applying the provisions in Chapter 2.  </p>

Consider a company which in accounting period 1 recognises in its STRGL an exchange loss from one of its loan relationships of £100, in accounting period 2 it recognises an exchange loss from that relationship of £200, in accounting period 3 it recognises an exchange gain of £50. It disposes of the loan relationship in accounting period 3. The effect of section 84A(8) and regulation 13(3) is that it brings into account a debit of £250 in accounting period 3. There is no difficulty in simply bringing that amount into account in accordance with regulation 13 as construed by the Respondents. Conversely it is very difficult to see how the ‘fairly represent’ test in section 84(1) could properly be applied since the debit has to fairly represent the profits, gains and losses of the company ‘for the accounting period in question’, that is for accounting period 3.  A debit of £250 cannot be said to fairly represent a loss for accounting period 3 during which there was in fact a gain of £50.  The aggregation of gains or losses to be brought into account in a single year simply does not work if the aggregate amount has to fairly represent the gain or loss in the year of disposal.  The introduction of the aggregation of gains and losses across the years appears to mean that in very many cases, the net loss or gain would not pass the ‘fairly represent’ test in section 84(1)(a) even though by enacting regulation 13, Parliament clearly intended that the amount would fall to be treated as a credit or debit for the purposes of section 82.  </p>

Exchange rate losses recognised in the profit and loss account fall within section 84A(1) because they are not carved out by subsection (3).  If, as HMRC assert, exchange gains and losses which fall within section 84A(1) are subject to the ‘fairly represent’ test in section 84(1), then it would be odd for the statute to treat them differently.

For the purposes of section 82(1), therefore, it is a debit or credit given for the accounting period in which the disposal took place by the provisions of Chapter 2 and can therefore be used to compute any deficit on a company’s loan relationship for the purpose of section 80(4).

Rather the question posed is: do the credits and debits to be brought into account fairly represent the exchange gains and losses arising to the company from its loan relationships?  In this case, Mr Ghosh argues that there is no difficulty with concluding that the debits that the Respondents are seeking to bring into account do fairly represent exchange losses because the amount of the debits are exactly the same as the amount of the exchange losses. Now that HMRC have conceded that the claimed debit is an exchange loss within the meaning of section 103(1A), there is nothing for the ‘fairly represent’ test to do. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Initially, during the course of argument in the appeal, Mr Ghosh referred to other circumstances in which a debit to be brought into account would not fairly represent an exchange loss arising from a loan relationship or at least in which there might be some debate about it, emphasising that that was not the case here.  Here, the debit is precisely the exchange loss (subject to the point discussed earlier about it in fact being an aggregate amount spanning several accounting periods). We invited the parties to suggest a scenario in which there might be some debate about whether a debit which a company was seeking to bring into account because of an exchange loss arising from its loan relationship might be said not fairly to represent a loss of the company.  It proved very difficult for the parties to come up with a plausible example.  The example proposed by the Respondents was a scenario adapted from the facts in two actual cases, <span style="font-style:italic">Stagecoach Group Plc &amp; another</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">v HMRC</span> [2016] UKFTT 120 (TC), [2016] SFTD 982 and <span style="font-style:italic">Union Castle Mail Steamship Company Ltd v HMRC</span> [2018] UKUT 316 (TCC) [2018] STC 2034. Those cases concerned a situation where Company A sold to Company B the rights to a percentage of the receipts expected to be generated by the loan relationship. As a matter of accounting, Company A was required to ‘de-recognise’ the loan relationship as to that percentage and enter an equivalent debit in its STRGL. Those two cases established that Company A was not entitled to relief for that debit because it did not fairly represent its losses arising from its loan relationships. One could adapt those facts to posit an exchange loss also having arisen at the time when the contracts which resulted in the derecognition are entered into. In those circumstances, by analogy with the two authorities cited, the debit would be disallowed on the basis that it did not fairly represent losses of the company from its loan relationships.  HMRC argued that that was not a good example because the reason why relief was denied for the debit in that case was not because of the application of the ‘fairly represent’ element of section 84(1)(a) but because the element that the debit must be in respect of the loan relationship was not satisfied. The debit would arise from the contract transferring the entitlement to receipts from the loan relationship and not from the loan relationship itself. </p>

That, in my judgment, supports the conclusion I arrived at in relation to the application of regulation 13.  It is less surprising that regulation 13 should bypass the ‘fairly represent’ test for exchange gains or losses recognised in the company’s STRGL if the ‘fairly represent’ test really has no immediately discernible application for exchange gains or losses recognised in the company’s profit and loss account which fall within section 84A(1).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, the Respondents argue that the recognition of the debit in respect of the exchange losses did indeed fairly represent a loss that had real-world consequences for the Smith &amp; Nephew group. The depreciation of sterling had a real and significant economic and commercial impact on the Respondents in two respects. First, so far as Overseas and TP are concerned, the group had to increase the capital that was needed as part of the restructuring.  As I described before, the consideration for the sale of TP by Smith &amp; Nephew plc to Overseas and the consideration for the sale of USD by Smith &amp; Nephew plc to TP was $3.5 billion each.  That valuation was, we were told, the result of an exercise carried out to arrive at a proper valuation of the assets of the part of the group being sold.  Mr Gibbon confirmed that HMRC did not challenge the legitimacy of the prices paid for the two companies.  In both cases the consideration was made up partly of cash payable on completion and partly of the premium on the single share in the buyer company which share was allotted to the seller.  The cash consideration was in both cases equal to the inter-company receivable owed to the transferred company. Since the purchase price was expressed in dollars, the receivable had to be converted to dollars in order to determine the split of consideration between cash and share premium.  The stronger sterling was against the dollar, the more dollars could be bought with the ICR, the higher the cash part of the consideration would be and the smaller the balancing payment in the form of share premium would need to be.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">For the sale of USD by Smith &amp; Nephew plc to TP the transaction worked like this.  The consideration payable by TP to Smith &amp; Nephew plc was fixed at US$3,500,000,000. The cash part of the consideration was fixed at US$772,367,000 because that was the dollar equivalent of the ICR of £524,242,838 owed by S&amp;N Holdings to TP, converted at the appropriate spot rate. The balance represented by the issue of a single share in the buyer, TP, given to the seller, Smith &amp; Nephew plc, was US$2,727,633,000.  That was the amount of capital that had to be raised to support that share premium. If sterling had still been as strong against the dollar as it had been on the last balance sheet date of 31 December 2007, then the receivable (being £524,242,838) would have been worth more dollars, in fact it would have been worth $1,044,292,056.  That larger sum then would have been the cash part of the consideration, leaving only a smaller balancing amount $2,455,707,944 to be made up by the value of the single share in the buyer, TP, given to the seller. The companies lacked the cash resources to make up the difference caused by the reduction in value in dollar terms of their sterling assets and therefore had to raise more capital to fund the shortfall.  The additional capital that had to be raised and was reflected on the balance sheet was therefore $271,925,056 greater than it would have been but for the </p>

The exchange losses are created by the retrospective recasting of the Respondents’ 2007 accounts into dollars for the purpose of comparing them with the 2008 accounts drawn up after the functional currency had changed.  If the loans had been disposed of on 23 December 2008 before the change of functional currency rather than a day later, the ICRs would not have been restated in dollars and no comparison between their value on that date and their value at the start of the previous year’s accounting period would have been needed. The dollar and sterling exchange rate did not of course start moving only on 1 January 2007; there would have been fluctuations in 2006 and 2005 when the ICR were also included in the Respondents’ accounts. That date was chosen because of the accounting method but introduced a certain arbitrariness in the valuation of the losses calculated.  Tax, he submitted, should reflect economic reality and should not tax something which is not an economic loss or benefit. The ‘fairly represent’ test was an open-textured phrase designed to achieve this.  </p>

Section 103(1A) provides for how exchange gains and losses are to be computed. It is a purely arithmetical exercise carried out to arrive at ‘a result of comparing at different times the expression in one currency of the whole or some part of the valuation put by the company in another currency on an asset or liability of the company’. As to what those ‘different times’ should be in any given case, that is determined by GAAP.  The FTT and UT by finding that the ‘foreign operations’ method was legitimate, thereby found also that the ‘different times’ used in the calculation of these exchange losses were the correct dates.   </p>

They did not, for example, say that a more ‘real’ calculation would be to compare the dollar value of the ICRs at the date the loans were first made with their value on 23 December 2008.  HMRC’s case seems to be that there was no amount that needed to be brought into account as a fair representation of the exchange loss arising on the disposal of these loan relationships.

I do not see how a court would make such an assessment. If Parliament had intended to exclude many or all of such a substantial category of exchange gains or losses from the regime, one would expect that to have been provided for expressly in Schedule 9 or in the definition of exchange gains or losses in section 103(1A).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the UT’s description of section 103(1A) in paras 68 and 69 of their judgment, set out at para. 37 above. Section 103(1A) is a tax code provision and not an accounting provision. It mandates that two dates are chosen for making the comparison rather than, for example, using an average rate between those dates and it does not require those dates to be chosen in any particular way other than in accordance with GAAP. Section 103(1A) does not, in my view, leave room for any imported requirement of reality or genuine suffering.  The search for some genuine or real loss arising for a company from exchange rate fluctuations would, in most cases, be illusory.  The earlier discussion about the hedging of exposure to currency risk demonstrates how impossible it would be to identify a ‘real’ loss suffered by a company by reason of adverse currency movements.  Companies do not operate like individuals buying a small amount of foreign currency to go on holiday. Such an individual may well suffer a ‘real’ loss when cashing in leftover dollars on their return home if the dollar has weakened against sterling whilst they were abroad. By contrast, hedging for foreign exchange exposure is a common and prudent step for any company, large or small, to take. It may be undertaken by going out into the financial markets and buying a swap corresponding to the particular exposure, or the particular exposure may be added to the company’s overall pool of currency exposure. In that pool, the sterling/dollar exposure may fortuitously be cancelled out by some equal and opposite dollar/sterling exposure that the company has arising from another transaction that it has entered into for the purposes of its business. To what extent would HMRC need to investigate how the hedge was achieved, at what price and whether it was strictly necessary before the company can show that there were ‘real world consequences’ for it of the currency fluctuation such that an exchange loss fairly represented some real world detriment?  The HMRC approach risks opening up a very complicated investigation which is not appropriate or indicated by the wording of the legislation.   </p>

This, he seemed to suggest, meant that they were less the result of economic activity than would otherwise be the case, pointing out that the Companies Acts have described a company’s accounts as comprising the balance sheet and the profit and loss account.  I do not accept that is a legitimate point. The statutory and accounting material we were shown shows that the STRGL was described as a primary financial statement that enables users to consider all recognised gains and losses of a reporting entity in assessing its overall performance. The accounting standard FRS 3 required the STRGL to be presented with the same prominence as other primary statements.

This latter point was bolstered by the submission that, if there had been an exchange gain, instead of an exchange loss, it would not have been taxable. </p>

The second was that a proper reading of sections 84(1)(a) and 84A(1) led to the conclusion that the debits in question necessarily fairly represented the exchange losses, because the figures were identical. </p>

On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008, HMRC told S&amp;N that “the credits in SNIH and debits arising from the release of the inter-company liabilities (including those owed to the Appellants) should be ignored for tax purposes but provided no assurance as to the capital gains tax consequences of the proposal”.  The restructuring, including the change of functional currency, was then devised by S&amp;N’s advisers to achieve the purpose they could not be certain to achieve by simply releasing the ICRs.  The suggestion, therefore, that there were real world consequences of the scheme must be viewed against that background, even though Mr Gibbon specifically submitted that no great weight should be placed on that fact.

I shall, however, change that order, dealing first with the inter-action between sections 84(1) and 84A(1) (acknowledging that that too was a respondents’ notice point), then with the “fairly represent” question, before returning to regulation 13. </p>

Her view is, I think, that the ‘fairly represent’ test would anyway have no discernible application here (if it applied, which she has held it does not), because the debits in question here do fairly represent exchange losses, being in exactly the same sums as those losses, HMRC having accepted that the debits were indeed exchange losses within section 103(1A) (see [64] above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there is a reason why the legislation is cast in this way.  That is because exchange gains and losses are of a different quality to other gains and losses incurred by a company in respect of its loan relationships.  Exchange losses are a fact that a company cannot change.  The only thing that can be changed by a company is the times at which comparisons are made.  The definition in section 103(1A) makes this clear.  Sections 85A and 85B provide that the amounts to be brought into account are to be in accordance with GAAP, and GAAP generally provides for the times at which comparisons are to be made.  Thus, as I see the case, once HMRC gave up its argument that the debits in question did not accord with GAAP, it had, in the circumstances of this case and its other concessions, little left in its armoury. </p>

I accept, of course, that section 84A(3) expressly disapplies section 84A(1) for those exchange losses.  But regulation 13(3) brings those very same losses, where there is a disposal, back into account for the purposes of Chapter 2 as a debit.  For the purposes of this argument, it does not seem to me to matter whether the exchange losses in question are mandatorily brought back in under regulation 13 as Rose LJ has held, or brought back in through section 84A(1) and 84(1)(a).  In the first case, there is no “fairly represents” requirement at all.  In the second case, the legislation provides that the debits to be brought into account are those sums that fairly represent the exchange losses.  The third option that Mr Gibbon suggested to the effect that the exchange losses come back in directly to section 84(1)(a), by-passing section 84A(1), cannot be correct.  The reference to “Chapter 2” in regulation 13(3) must include the whole of Chapter 2, and there must be some congruity between the tax treatment of exchange losses in the profit and loss account and in the STRGL.  </p>

I bear in mind the background features that I have referred to above, and do not think that HMRC’s arguments can be so easily dismissed.

Moreover, the reference to “as a credit or debit” in regulation 13(3) is consistent with an exchange loss being required to satisfy section 84(1). This argument is given some further support by section 84A(9), which provides that “bringing amounts into account” in section 84A(8) “is a reference to bringing amounts into account—(a) for the purposes of this Chapter, <span style="font-weight:bold">as credits or debits</span> in respect of the loan relationships of the company concerned” (emphasis added). </p>

Since it was common ground that the debits in question complied with GAAP, they had to be brought into account under section 84(1)(a) because they were the sums that fairly represented the exchange losses which had arisen to the companies from their loan relationships. </p>
