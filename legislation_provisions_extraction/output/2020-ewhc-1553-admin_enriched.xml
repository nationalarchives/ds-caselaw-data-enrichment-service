<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">On 15 November 2019 the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal (“<abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr>”) made an order suspending the respondent from practice for a period of nine months followed by a review at the end of that period. The GMC appeals against that order under section 40A of the <ref canonical="1983 c. 54" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54" type="legislation">Medical Act 1983</ref>. It contends that the sanction is insufficient to protect the public. </p>

<content>
<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">In order to succeed on the appeal, the appellant must show either that the decision of <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr> was wrong, or that it was unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr>. The latter limb is not relied on by the appellant; it argues through Mr Hare QC that the decision is wrong because <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr> erred by failing to take into account a relevant matter; by taking into account an irrelevant matter; and by failing to apply properly the GMC’s Sanctions Guidance dated 6 February 2018. In such circumstances it is argued that the decision to suspend the respondent for nine months was wrong and I should replace it with a decision to erase the respondent’s name from the register. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">When exercising its functions through its disciplinary tribunal (and generally) the GMC is fixed with the over-arching objective of the protection of the public (see<ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54/section/1" uk:canonical="1983 c. 54 s. 1">section 1</ref>(1A) <ref canonical="1983 c. 54" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54" type="legislation">Medical Act 1983</ref>). The pursuit of that over-arching objective involves the pursuit of the objectives of protecting, promoting and maintaining the health, safety and well-being of the public; promoting and maintaining public confidence in the medical profession; and promoting and maintaining proper professional standards and conduct for members of that profession (see<ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54/section/1" uk:canonical="1983 c. 54 s. 1">section 1</ref>(1B)).  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">Therefore, when exercising its disciplinary functions, the overarching objective of the tribunal is the protection of the public. Thus, a sanctions decision is not penal. Rather, it is from first to last motivated only by the need to protect the public in the sense spelt out above. As stated above, the decision is not narrowly confined to protecting the health and safety of the public. It extends to maintaining public confidence in the reputation of the medical profession and the need to promote and maintain high professional standards and conduct of its members.

The FPP thus looks forward not back. However, in order to form a view as to the fitness of a person to practise today, it is evident that it will have to take account of the way in which the person concerned has acted or failed to act in the past." </p>

To maintain this reputation and sustain public confidence in the integrity of the profession it is often necessary that those guilty of serious lapses are not only expelled but denied re-admission… A profession's most valuable asset is its collective reputation and the confidence which that inspires. … The reputation of the profession is more important than the fortunes of any individual member.

It is because specific findings of fact, even by the most meticulous judge, are inherently an incomplete statement of the impression which was made upon him by the primary evidence. His expressed findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification and nuance (as Renan said, <span style="font-style:italic">"La vérité est dans une nuance"), </span>of which time and language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the judge's overall evaluation." </p>

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law.

<p style="margin-left:1.19in;margin-right:1.04in">"The exigencies of daily court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case … These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the matters in question are so well known as those specified in section 25(2) [of the <ref canonical="1973 c. 18" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>]. An appellate court should resist the temptation to subvert the principle that they should not substitute their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual analysis which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself." </p>

However, it recognised the steps that Dr Awan has taken towards remediation. It noted from Dr Awan’s GMC witness statement that he has completed a number of CPD courses to improve his knowledge and understanding of social media. The Tribunal considered that Dr Awan has made some efforts to reflect on his behaviour and has started to put measures in place to ensure that this conduct is not repeated. He told <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr> that he no longer uses chat rooms and has found other methods to ‘de-stress’. The Tribunal had regard to the positive testimonials provided in support of Dr Awan. It is clear that he is a well-regarded doctor and that there are no clinical concerns. The Tribunal noted that there is no evidence that Dr Awan has repeated his misconduct. For all these reasons, it therefore determined that the risk of repetition in this case is low.    </p>

<p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">“Their Lordships enquired of Mr Greene, counsel for the GMC, whether it was a general GMC practice where charges of professional misconduct were being made to add to the factual allegations on which the charges were based an allegation of dishonesty in the event that the respondent doctor had had the temerity to deny any of the factual allegations. Counsel told their Lordships that it was not the general practice and that he was not aware of a previous case where that had been done. No explanation of why it was thought right to add the allegations of dishonesty in the present case was offered. In their Lordships' opinion the addition of the allegations of dishonesty in the present case was unnecessary and oppressive. The allegations added nothing to what would have been shown to be the degree of culpability of Dr Misra if the substantive allegations that he had declined to admit were found proved against him.” </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">It is for this reason that explicit admissions of culpability tend not to be given in the impairment and sanctions phase. Rather, language alters to the passive voice and statements in the genre of “I am sorry if what I have said has caused you to take offence” are made. Thus, in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">General Medical Council v X</span> [2019] EWHC 493, which has some striking similarities to this one, the “admission” following the factual finding was (at para 32):   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The second ground of appeal is that <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr> had regard to an irrelevant factor namely the public interest in not depriving the public of the services of an otherwise competent doctor (see the final sentence of para 24 of the sanctions decision set out above). The argument is that the public interest in question relates only to the UK public and because the respondent has since emigrated to Canada it is not in play in this case. I cannot accept this argument. It is, I suppose, implicit in the terms of<ref uk:type="legislation" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54/section/1" uk:canonical="1983 c. 54 s. 1">section 1</ref>(1A) and 1(1B) of the <ref canonical="1983 c. 54" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54" type="legislation">Medical Act 1983</ref> that the public there referred to is the UK public. One would like to think, however, that the objective of protection would extend to the global community. However, there was no reason to suppose that the decision to emigrate made by the respondent was irrevocable. Moreover, and more importantly, I do not regard this single sentence as being a key element of the decision-making process. It is almost as if it was added on as an afterthought. In my judgment if this sentence did contain an error it was not a material one. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.03in">The third ground of appeal is that <abbr title="Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal">the Tribunal</abbr> made two significant failings in its application of the Sanctions Guidance. I have dealt with the first alleged failing at para 32 above. In my judgment it is meritless. The second alleged failing is that the tribunal failed explicitly to reference the relevant parts of para 109 of the Sanctions Guidance which deal with possible erasure.
