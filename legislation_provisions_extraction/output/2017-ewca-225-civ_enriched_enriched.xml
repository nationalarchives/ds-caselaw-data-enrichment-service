<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The issue in this appeal is whether, when quantifying a <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> payable by a lessee under a long lease of residential property, credit must be given by the lessor in respect of a third party contribution towards the cost of carrying out repairs and improvements to the property, so as to avoid any element of double recovery by the lessor.  The question is mainly one of construction of the relevant long lease, but the parties prayed in aid in support of their submissions various aspects of the extensive statutory framework affecting the recovery of <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr>s, both as a supposed aid to construction and for the purpose of determining the extent of the jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal and of this court to depart from the quantification of the <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> by the person identified in the lease as having that responsibility.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This issue arose out of a much more general challenge to the recoverability by the lessor of a <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> in connection with its carrying out of large-scale repairs and improvements to the relevant property, and to the block of flats and maisonettes of which it formed part, and only emerged for the first time when the case was appealed by the (largely unsuccessful) lessee from the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal for the Northern Rent Assessment Panel (“<abbr title="the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal for the Northern Rent Assessment Panel">the LVT</abbr>”) to the Upper Tribunal.  As will appear, the Upper Tribunal resolved the issue in favour of the lessee, so that it arises in this court on the lessor’s appeal.</p>

D. McCrea FRICS, namely the Main Decision dated 12 May 2015 <ref canonical="[2015] UKUT 0229 (LC)" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/lc/2015/0229" isneutral="true" type="case" year="2015">[2015] UKUT 0229 (LC)</ref> and the Addendum to that decision dated 7 September 2015 <ref canonical="[2015] UKUT 0494 (LC)" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/lc/2015/0494" isneutral="true" type="case" year="2015">[2015] UKUT 0494 (LC)</ref>.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant Council is the freehold owner of the Lansdowne and Hanover Estates (“<abbr title="Lansdowne and Hanover Estates">the Estates</abbr>”), which consist of some 1,000 flats and maisonettes, contained in forty separate blocks, groups of which are connected by walkways and stair-towers to form “super-blocks”.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Estates were constructed between 1968 and 1972 to a non-traditional construction, involving the use of a concrete frame with masonry cross walls.  The main elevations were enclosed by in-filled panels comprising timber studwork hung at alternate levels with clay tile cladding or a composite material of glass reinforced plastic known as Asbestolux. In the absence of further major investment, non-traditional construction of this kind ordinarily has a service life of between 20 to 30 years.  Prior to the major refurbishment work described below, only routine maintenance had been carried out in relation to <abbr title="Lansdowne and Hanover Estates">the Estates</abbr>, with the exception of certain cavity insulation to some of the properties in 2003.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Oliver is a former social housing tenant who exercised her right to buy her property, namely 128 Cliff Street, which is a two storey maisonette located in block L13 on the Lansdowne Estate.

I will call her maisonette “the Property”, Block L13 “the Block” and her long lease “the Lease”.  The Block and the Property are respectively called “the Building” and “the demised premises” in the Lease.

Of much greater relevance for present purposes was the fact that <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> also received substantial funding (“CESP funding”) from the Community Energy Savings Programme, which had been established by the Electricity and Gas (Community Energy Savings Programme) Order 2009 (SI 2009/1905), pursuant to an agreement with NPower made on 15 May 2012 (“the NPower Agreement”).  The CESP Programme ran from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.  Under the Programme, the then Department of Energy and Climate Change set a community target for reduction in carbon emissions which was to be met by requiring commercial gas and electricity suppliers to fund energy saving measures for domestic consumers.  The CESP was targeted at low income areas, and enabled gas and electricity suppliers to meet carbon emissions targets either by making arrangements with individual home owners, or (and in practice more frequently) with social housing providers such as <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>.  The Programme applied to strictly delineated geographical areas, and required works to be done within a prescribed period of time.  Part of <abbr title="Lansdowne and Hanover Estates">the Estates</abbr>, including the Block and the Property, fell within a qualifying area, but some other blocks within <abbr title="Lansdowne and Hanover Estates">the Estates</abbr> did not.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">On Ms Oliver’s appeal to the Upper Tribunal, she lost again on the main issue, but largely succeeded on the question whether <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> should have deducted its CESP receipts, to the extent attributable to the cladding work on her Property and (in part) attributable to the whole house bonus.  The Upper Tribunal concluded that, to the extent that <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s expenditure on the cladding works had been funded by NPower under the CESP Scheme, that part of the cost had not been incurred by <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> within the meaning either of clause 3(29) of, or paragraph 1 of Part III of the Schedule to, the Lease.  The gist of its decision is to be found in paragraph 120, as follows:</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“In principle we do not think it is open to <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> to calculate the <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> without reference to the receipt by it from a commercial third party of funds specifically intended to meet the cost of part of the works.  We do not consider that <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> has “incurred” those costs within the meaning of the lease in circumstances where in the course of the contract, it reached agreement with a third party which bound that party to reimburse part of the cost.  The fact that the CESP funding was not limited to properties let to <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s own secure tenants, but was equally applicable to work done to those belonging to its long leaseholders, prohibits <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> from treating the funding as if it was part of its general revenue.  If <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> had not carried out the specific items of work which it now seeks to charge to the leaseholders it would not have received the CESP funds.  In those circumstances for it to retain the CESP funding while recovering the leaseholders’ contributions towards the cost of the work in full would amount to double recovery.”</p>

It being difficult therefore to decide whether the whole house bonus represented a further deduction from the cost which <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> had incurred, the Tribunal concluded that the fairest way to deal with it was to allow for a 50% deduction of that bonus: see paragraph 10.  By contrast, no part of the area bonus which (by a process of long division) might be said to be attributable to the Property was required to be deducted, because the cause of <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s receipt of that bonus was “too remote” to require credit to be given for it at all: see paragraph 11.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Baker sought to bolster his submission about the ordinary meaning of “incurred” by reference to statutory usage of that word in legislation about public housing, the right to buy and <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr>s, upon the basis that those responsible for drafting the Lease might reasonably be supposed to have had that statutory meaning in mind.  He referred in particular to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/41/section/90/12" uk:canonical="1972 c. 41 s. 90" uk:type="legislation">s.90(12)</ref> of the Housing <ref canonical="1972 c. 41" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/41" type="legislation">Finance Act 1972</ref>, to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/41/section/124" uk:canonical="1972 c. 41 s. 124" uk:type="legislation">s.124</ref> of the <ref canonical="1974 c. 44" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1974/44" type="legislation">Housing Act 1974</ref>, and to Schedule 19 to the <ref canonical="1980 c. 51" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/51" type="legislation">Housing Act 1980</ref>, all of which use phrases such as “costs incurred” and “liability incurred”.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Baker did not altogether discount the possibility that the avoidance of double recovery, or of the making of a profit by <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> pursuant to the <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> provisions in the Lease, might have a role to play in the determination of a “fair proportion” of costs incurred to be paid by a particular lessee within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Part III of the Schedule.  But he submitted that there had been nothing at all unfair or unreasonable in <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s decision to spread the benefit of the CESP payments across the whole of the Estate, for the benefit of all its long leaseholders.  Since <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> decided not to charge any of its leaseholders a proportion of the costs of boiler replacement or professional charges, <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> had not in any event made a profit out of the <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> provisions overall.  </p>

He submitted that, in that respect, the <span style="font-style:italic">Gater</span> decision of the Upper Tribunal was wrong and should be overruled.  The purpose of that section was only to prevent an ouster of the jurisdiction of the Tribunals, but a provision in a lease for the non-final determination of a fair proportion to be paid left intact the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, on rationality grounds, to set aside that determination if satisfied that it was unfair.

The <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> provisions in the Lease must therefore be construed so as to achieve the objective of preventing double recovery.

As to (ii), (which Lewison LJ, whose judgment I have read in draft, prefers), I am concerned that it places an excessive burden on the draftsman’s distinction between estimated and actual costs, expenses and outgoings in a paragraph designed to provide for balancing payments or repayments where actuals prove to be different to those estimated.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of Mr Baker’s persuasive submissions that there was nothing necessarily unfair about <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s own approach to the spreading of the benefit of the CESP funds across all its long leaseholders, regardless whether their properties fell within the geographical or time constraints of the Scheme, it becomes necessary for this court to decide whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Windermere</span> and, more importantly, <span style="font-style:italic">Gater</span> cases were rightly decided, in treating the apportionment carried out by the Lessor’s Surveyor or (here) <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s appointed officer, as irrelevant.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view those cases were rightly decided, for the reasons given by the Upper Tribunal in each of them, to which I have already referred.  The Upper Tribunal was careful in both those cases to distinguish between a situation where the determination was to be carried out in a prescribed manner (for example by a person with discretion as to the result), and a situation where a particular determination was the only possible consequence of the application of an agreed formula.  The former provision falls foul of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/70/section/27" uk:canonical="1985 c. 70 s. 27" uk:type="legislation">s.27</ref>A(6), whereas the latter does not, because the precise amount to be paid has been determined by the parties’ agreement: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/70/section/27" uk:canonical="1985 c. 70 s. 27" uk:type="legislation">s.27</ref>A(4)(a).</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment the Upper Tribunal was right to say in the <span style="font-style:italic">Gater</span> case that for this purpose it mattered not whether the provision that the determination be carried out in a particular way or by a particular person was expressed to be final and binding.  The avoidance of such provisions is not expressed in subsection (6) to be dependent upon the presence of such an express provision.  It is void wherever it would otherwise be of contractually determinative effect.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The result is that this court must determine the fair proportion of <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s costs incurred to be levied as a <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> upon Ms Oliver, without having first to conclude that <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>’s apportionment was unfair or unreasonable.  In my judgment the determination of a fair proportion does require <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr> to give credit for the relevant parts of CESP funding received in relation to, and only by reason of, the works which it carried out in respect of the Property.  Fairness in this context is to be achieved by the avoidance of double recovery, as the Upper Tribunal concluded.  </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">As to the base figures (for which see the table in paragraph 6 of the Addendum decision), I would, like the Upper Tribunal, require a full deduction in relation to the cladding, but none in relation to the boiler or radiator valves, since the cost of those items was not charged to Ms Oliver.  I would also agree, for the reasons given by the Upper Tribunal, that no part of the area bonus need be deducted as against Ms Oliver’s liability.  </p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">I have found the fair apportionment of the whole house bonus slightly more difficult, mainly because the overwhelming majority of that bonus was, in terms of calculation, attributable to the cladding.  If I had been considering the matter without regard to the Upper Tribunal’s analysis, I might well have concluded that a fairer apportionment would be a deduction of £1,885.44, rather than 50% of the aggregate sum of £2,210.41.  Nonetheless, for the reasons which I have given, I consider that in substance the Upper Tribunal was conducting a fairness apportionment in relation to the whole house bonus, rather than a mechanical assessment of the amount of costs that had been incurred by <abbr title="appellant lessor, Sheffield City Council">the Council</abbr>.  In those circumstances I do not consider that I should depart from the Upper Tribunal’s 50% apportionment, since it was within the range of fair outcomes available to the decision maker.</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“One speaks of something being "actually" the case to point a contrast; perhaps with what appears to be the case, or with what might be the case, or with what is deemed to be the case. The effect of the word therefore depends upon the nature of the distinction which the speaker is wanting to make. This can appear only from the context in which the phrase is used. ”</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Plainly one contrast in paragraph 6 of the <abbr title="Service Charge">service charge</abbr> schedule is between the estimated cost and the actual cost. But it is pertinent to ask in any particular case: why does the actual cost differ from the estimated cost? One possible answer, which in my judgment is the answer in this case, is that since the cost was estimated part of it has been paid by a third party, namely NPower. The actual cost to the landlord has therefore been reduced by that amount.</p>
