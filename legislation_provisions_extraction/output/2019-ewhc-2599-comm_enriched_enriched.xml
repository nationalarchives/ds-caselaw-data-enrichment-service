Although drifting, the vessel was in the course of a voyage from Kerch in the Ukraine to China with a cargo of fuel oil.

There is cogent evidence that, when the small boat was off the starboard quarter of the vessel, those on board the small boat said they were “security”.

<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">“scuttling” is alleged tend to last many days for a number of reasons. First, there is rarely direct evidence of fraud. If a finding of fraud is made it is usually an inference drawn from a large number of matters connected with the event which befell the ship, the events leading up to the casualty, the events after the casualty and the conduct of the owner’s business as a shipowner.  Accordingly the scope of enquiry, and hence of disclosure, is wide. For the same reason there are many issues to be opened to the judge at the commencement of the trial. Second, the loss of the ship, whether actual or constructive, means that the technical enquiry into the cause of loss is difficult. If the ship has been sunk surveys are either impossible or of limited scope. If the ship has been damaged by fire that very damage impedes the discovery of the cause. Rather than serving to limit the number of technical issues a paucity of evidence tends to expand the number of such issues. Third, the conduct alleged against the owner and, as is usually the case, the master and chief engineer, is a crime. An adverse finding will involve damage to the reputation of the Owner and to the employment prospects of the master and chief engineer. For that reason, their cross-examination cannot, in fairness to them, be rushed or limited. For the same reason the cross-examination of those with relevant evidence to give, whether factual or expert, can be expected to be thorough. Fourth, by reason of the nature of the enquiry the owner (or in this case <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>) will usually seek to establish a plausible explanation, consistent with the evidence, not only for the loss of his vessel but also for those matters which might otherwise be regarded as suspicious. That can involve much technical investigation and therefore much expert evidence. Fifth, events often occur during the course of the preparation for trial which redefine the focus of the enquiry. In the present case, there were at least two such events. First, after a “whistle-blower” had said that there had been deliberate damage in the engine room to fuel the fire the photographs of the damaged purifier room were examined again. That examination revealed a broken drain cock to a diesel oil service tank in the purifier room. That led to an investigation into when, how and why that damage occurred. The Underwriters said that it was deliberate, whilst <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> said that it was plausible to suggest that it had been caused by a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (a <abbr title="Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion">“BLEVE</abbr>”). The investigation involved not only the marine engineering experts but also the fire experts. Thus further reports were required from them after the discovery of the broken drain cock. Second, a large number of photographs of the vessel taken during the fire were provided to <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> (by Five Oceans Salvage) just four months before the trial began. That led to further reports by the fire experts and to what had been common ground being disputed. Events of this nature, which are not uncommon in alleged scuttling cases, inevitably lead to lengthy cross-examination of the experts.  </p>

In the present case there were, I think, at least three such documents, or categories of documents, which could have been identified before the start of the trial as meriting a hard copy. First, there was the “naval log” (emanating from the naval forces protecting merchant ships from piracy, see below at paragraph 217) which recorded certain events or reports contemporaneously. It was of real evidential value and the subject of frequent reference during the trial. Second, there were the photographs. When several photographs have to be compared and noted hard copies are, I think, essential. Third, there was the correspondence concerning the engagement of the security team between 1 and 5 July 2011 which was the subject of detailed submissions.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.00in">The final matter to consider when the documents in the case are in electronic form is the ability of the judge to locate relevant documents to which he or she has been referred during the trial. The form in which documents are stored electronically does of course permit the user to note and categorise classes of relevant documents for later ease of reference. In a long trial with many issues, when the judge is seeking to follow and understand the evidence, that is not always possible. Leading Counsel has a team of people behind him or her to assist in locating relevant documents. The judge does not and does not have the time to spend perusing the electronic file in the hope of locating a document to which reference has been made. Reference to the transcript can reveal the document (and provide an immediate electronic link to it) but that requires time to peruse the transcripts. A possible solution to this problem is to ensure that the chronology is fully referenced and that there is on key issues an index which collates key references; see The Commercial Court Guide paragraph J6.4. A good (and most helpful) example of such a document in this case was the index of photographs showing the time and date of the photographs together with references to the experts’ comments on them.        </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Somali pirate attacks on commercial shipping had emerged as a significant phenomenon in 2008 and were starting to decline by the second half of 2011. Somali piracy was a unique and distinctive form of piracy. Its modus operandi was characterised by high speed armed attacks using skiffs and a “business model” based around holding hijacked vessels and crews for ransom. Somali pirates mostly preyed on busy shipping lanes and did not focus their activity on the approaches to Yemeni harbours or anchorages (such as the approaches to Al Mukallah or Aden). By mid2011, Somali attacks took place more frequently in Bab el Mandeb and the Indian Ocean, rather than in the Gulf of Aden; and, outside Bab el Mandeb, they did not normally take place in territorial waters. </p>

In response to such attacks the shipping industry had produced a guide to shipowners and masters recommending certain steps designed to avoid such attacks. The guidance was set out in a document known as Best Management Practice (“<abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr>”). In 2011 it was in its third edition (“<abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3”). The guidance stated that the master retained discretion as to the appropriate steps to be taken. There was also an Admiralty chart, entitled AntiPiracy Planning Chart (not a navigational chart) which specifically dealt with the risks </p>

Shipowners do not generally resort to scuttling and an allegation that a shipowner has done so is a grave charge to make. Thus, as Aikens J. said in <span style="font-style:italic">The Milasan</span>, "effectively the standard of proof will fall not far short of the criminal standard". Precisely what that means and how the court determines whether the charge of scuttling has been proved on the balance of probabilities has been elucidated in the cases, in particular by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">National Justice Compania Naviera SA v Prudential Assurance (The Ikarian Reefer)</span> [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 455. Thus, if [the underwriter] is unable to exclude "a substantial as opposed to a fanciful or remote possibility that the loss was accidental" the court will be unable to draw the inference. But "the mere existence of an opposing possibility does not prevent the balance from tilting heavily and sufficiently far in favour of the insurers" (see p.459 rhc). To the same effect is the following later passage: "there must be a real or plausible explanation which is supported by the evidence, or at the least is not inconsistent with it……..It imposes too high a burden on the underwriters to say that such witnesses must be telling the truth unless the underwriters prove their accounts are impossible" (see p. 484 lhc).

In the present case it was accepted on both sides that the vessel had been damaged by a deliberately created fire. The question was as to the identity of the person behind those who started the fire and as to their motives. The case of the Underwriters was that Mr. Iliopoulos planned to scuttle the vessel and was behind the armed men who boarded the vessel and set fire to it.

Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one's reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.………….” </p>

Lord Hoffman’s example is a simple and clear illustration of the point he was making. The facts of the present case are more complicated and involve a number of participants.

In particular Flaux J. held that his evidence seeking to explain why an electronic archive of documents had not been provided to his solicitors as ordered by the court was “a fabricated story designed to provide the owners with an excuse for not handing over the archive to Hill Dickinson”. Indeed, Mr. Iliopoulos was held to have been responsible for a “charade, maintained through collusion” between Mr. Iliopoulos and two associates. There was even a “charade, acted out for [Hill Dickinson’s] benefit” to persuade the solicitors of the truth of Mr. Iliopoulos’ explanation for not handing over the archive.

The master gave his evidence by video link, initially from the Philippines and then from Singapore. He did so between 6 pm and midnight, his time. The video link was not initially ideal because it depended on a wi-fi connection in the Philippines which was not as efficient as it ought to have been. The picture quality was often poor. The master spoke English but his diction and/or accent meant that it was often difficult to be sure that one had understood the entirety of his answer. Counsel therefore spent time, very properly, checking that his answer had been correctly understood. In order to get a better video link the master was moved to Singapore. The link was better, but from time to time the screen froze.  </p>

He sometimes appeared to consider his answer to a question for a very long time.  But he was not giving evidence in his own language and he comes from a different culture.

For example, when asked whether he was concerned at the approach of a small boat he said he was not because it might have been a boat selling fish. He was asked whether the fact that those approaching in the small boat not only carried arms (which he accepted would heighten his concern) but also wore masks was a reason for yet more concern. The master said he did not think so. When asked why, he said that the masks might protect against dust. When it was pointed out that the boat was at sea, he said that the masks might be protection against infection. He later suggested that the men might be wearing masks to avoid a bad smell. These answers suggested that, having appreciated where counsel’s questions were going, he was prepared to say whatever was necessary to avoid making admissions which might later prove to be damaging. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> suggested, without any support from the master, that he “most likely had in mind protection from fumes/dust emanating from cargoes, or from a ship that did not yet have any port clearance, including clearance from quarantine.” I did not consider that likely at all. </p>

In his Aden and Manila statements (made in July and September 2011) he said that he was told that the men were the authorities. Following disclosure of the VDR audio record he had to recognise in his 2015 and 2018 statements that he had been told that they were security. Yet in his oral evidence in 2019 he said that he thought that the men were the authorities. He said that was why he had allowed them to board. But in his 2018 statement he had said that it was only when he had been told the men were security that he allowed the pilot ladder to be lowered. His unheralded oral evidence was striking and suggested, at best, that the master had no reliable recollection of who he thought the men were and, at worst, that he was prepared to say that which he thought best explained his conduct in allowing the men to board regardless of whether it was the truth. </p>

There was clear evidence in the form of contemporaneous emails that whilst reporting the quantity of bunkers ROB to his owners he was, at the same time, reporting lesser quantities to the charterers. His explanation was that there had been an error in the figures provided to him by the engineers who sounded the bunker tanks. However, this did not explain why he had given different figures to his owners than he had to the charterers. He denied that he was deliberately giving false information to the charterers but the contemporaneous documents suggested that he was. He had a similar difficulty with the figures he gave to his owners and to the charterers for the quantity of bunkers consumed in a day. They were different and the circumstances suggested that he was seeking to mislead the charterers into thinking that bunkers were being used to heat the cargo. Again, his explanation that he was merely passing on figures provided to him by the engineers made no sense because it did not explain why he was giving the owners and charterers different figures.   </p>

When the charterers were informed they sent a surveyor but the master accepted that he had prevented the surveyor from boarding. His explanations for doing so, for example, that the surveyor had arrived after bunkering had been completed, were difficult to reconcile with the contemporaneous documents. His answers to such difficulties suggested that, as with the documents concerning the differing ROB and consumption figures, he was prepared to say whatever enabled him not to accept the propositions put to him based upon the contemporaneous documents.  </p>

In particular, there was inconsistency in his evidence as to whether he slowed and stopped the main engine in the early hours of 6 July or whether it stopped itself. There was also inconsistency in his evidence as to whether there was a fire in way of the CO2 room or not. Similarly there was inconsistency in his evidence as to whether the cargo was at risk of explosion or not. These differences could be the result of the effect of the passage of time since 2011 on his recollection but the differences were so striking that I was left with the impression that at best his recollection of what had happened had been lost several years ago.

He had great difficulty in answering the question whether he had given that account at the time. He kept insisting that the statement to which he was referred was not his statement. This insistence suggested that he feared that accepting that he had told the US Navy that he had sabotaged the main engine, when he had not, would be damaging. If he did fear that, he was right to do so. The account he gave to the US Navy was not true. The main engine had not been sabotaged. Neither party suggested that it had been sabotaged.

If the latter were the case then he must have had a very close relationship with Mr. Iliopoulos indeed.  An email from Mr. Iliopoulos dated 23 December 2011 made clear that “the successful outcome” was success in making good the Owner’s claim that the vessel was a CTL.

He was in Aden in 2011 and gave evidence that Mr. Vergos told him that Mr. Iliopoulos had told him about “a job to destroy a vessel for the purposes of an insurance claim” and that on the night of 5 July 2011 he heard Mr. Vergos tell the crew of his salvage tug, VOUKEFALAS, that they were not going to sleep that night. “You are up for a job”. </p>

In 2017 he was asked by the police to make a statement setting out his evidence and did so. He made that statement under a pseudonym in order to protect his identity. He feared that he might come to harm if his real identity were known. The Underwriters learnt of his evidence and wished to call him as a witness in this case. They knew his real name and applied for an order allowing his real name to be used. I granted that application on the grounds that his identity was already known to those who, it was said, might harm him but that his whereabouts were not known and it was that which would continue to protect him; see <ref canonical="[2018] EWHC 2929 (Comm)" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2018/2929" isneutral="true" type="case" year="2018">[2018] EWHC 2929 (Comm)</ref>.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">However, in evaluating his evidence a number of matters must be borne in mind. First, Mr. Plakakis made very serious allegations against several people. His written account which was before the court was made in 2017, some 6 years after the events in question. That itself is a cause for concern as to the reliability of his evidence (notwithstanding the point made by counsel for the Underwriters that “the existence of a fraudulent conspiracy to destroy an oil tanker by staging a piracy attack is not the sort of thing one forgets”). Although he said that he had made an earlier statement in 2014 that earlier statement was not before the court and so it could not be compared with his 2017 statement. Second, much of his evidence was based upon what he had been told by Mr. Vergos who, he accepted, was a liar and whom he did not trust. That is a further cause for concern as to the reliability of his evidence (although I accept, as counsel for the Underwriters point out, that some of his evidence, for example, what he heard Mr. Vergos say to the crew on 5 July was direct evidence). Third, he implicated persons in the alleged conspiracy who were not said by the Underwriters to be party to the conspiracy. Those allegations (as to which the Underwriters were “neutral”, a stance explained by “a desire not to repeat inessential allegations about third parties in Greece without the protection of a court order”) were therefore not the subject of investigation in this trial. That is a reason for exercising caution with regard to his evidence. Fourth, his understanding of the conspiracy was that its purpose was not only to defraud <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s underwriters but also to enable Poseidon Salvage to make a claim for salvage based upon a danger to the casualty which the Owner had created. But in the event the LOF salvage contract was awarded to Five Oceans Salvage with Poseidon as a sub-contractor. That suggests that his evidence may be unreliable.  </p>

The common ground was striking. They both said that the attack on the vessel was staged on the instructions of Mr. Iliopoulos with the assistance of Mr. Vergos, that the master and chief engineer were involved, that members of the Yemeni coast guard had been recruited to pretend to be pirates and that the call at Aden to pick up a security team was an alibi for the incident.     </p>

But the expert evidence of piracy fulfilled an important purpose before the trial commenced. It enabled the parties to agree that it was unlikely that the armed men who boarded the vessel were Somali pirates, but were, on the balance of probabilities, members of the Yemeni Coast Guard or Navy. The joint memorandum of the piracy experts was a model of what such reports should be; full, informative and helpful. What remained was the question whether the armed men were in fact pirates or were persons who pretended to be pirates at the request of Mr. Iliopoulos. Of course that question is not a matter for any expert. It is a matter for the court to consider on the basis of all the relevant evidence. However, the piracy and Yemeni criminality experts considered the question whether it was “plausible” to suggest that the attack on the vessel was “an attempt by Yemeni crooks to join the Somali piracy bandwagon.” The Bank’s experts on piracy and Yemeni criminality expressed the view that it was plausible to suggest the armed men were Yemeni pirates who planned to take the vessel to Somalia and there do a deal with Somali pirates which involved sharing a ransom for the vessel and cargo. The Underwriters’ experts did not agree that that was plausible. By the end of the crossexamination of the experts on piracy and Yemeni criminality the issue which rose to the surface was whether, given that there was evidence of criminal dealings between Somalis and Yemenis across the Gulf of Aden involving smuggling, drugs and people trafficking, it was plausible or likely that such criminal dealings might extend to joint ventures involving the hijack of vessels for ransom. The four experts approached that question from different vantage points.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the issues to be considered in resolving the issue as to the likely intent of the Yemeni armed intruders was the extent to which they would apprehend risk or danger in seeking to hijack a vessel and then to deal with Somali pirates. Dr. Shortland expressed an opinion as to the extent to which Somali pirates were in fact violent and used this to suggest that the risks of pirates being violent were less than they are commonly thought to be. She has not been to Somalia and I did not find her evidence on this topic to be persuasive. It was, I thought, inconsistent, even muddled. On the one hand she expressed the opinion that there was much “posturing and display – undertaken precisely to avoid bloodshed and damage”. On the other hand she eventually accepted that piracy works better when pirates have “a reputation for extreme violence”. She also relied upon certain assumptions which could not be supported. For example she said that Somali pirates fired across the bow and so posed no actual danger. Yet the <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 document recognised that the bridge was the focus of attack and suggested measures that could be taken to protect those on the bridge at the time of attack. She had no direct experience of counter-piracy operations.   </p>

On the one hand her careful study of Somali piracy had persuaded her that, more often than not, threats of violence by Somali pirates were not carried out. She expressed the opinion that “keeping piracy non-violent was seen as essential to the business”.  On the other hand she accepted in cross-examination that there were in fact three risks, namely, expropriation of the ship, physical maltreatment up to and including murder and detention and imprisonment. It seemed to me that when assessing the perceived risks to the Yemeni intruders she appeared to assume that the Yemenis would be aware of the conclusions she had drawn from her careful academic assessment of the available data. That did not appear to me to be a realistic approach.  She has never visited Yemen.  </p>

This change of view came about after it had been agreed by other experts that it could not be assumed that one of the intruders, described as “dark skinned”, was a Somali. It was also suggested that she expressed opinions on matters on which she had no expertise. For example she expressed the opinion that “from an economic point of view, hijack for ransom offered significantly greater returns than (armed) robbery – and more certain returns than insurance fraud.” Dr. Shortland was not an expert on the returns from insurance fraud.

The fact that the hijacking was so bungled also suggests that the particular “pirates” had relatively little, if any, experience in this nefarious activity.” It was unclear that he had any expertise which enabled him to say that it was plausible or likely that the particular form of criminal activity in which the armed men might engage to supplement their income would be the hijack of ships for ransom with the assistance of Somali pirates. His first report (and his answers when crossexamined) suggested that what enabled him to reach his conclusion was an analysis of (some) of the evidence in the case that suggested that the armed men who boarded the vessel intended to hijack the vessel and take it to Somalia. This of course was not a matter which properly engaged his expertise but required an assessment of all the evidence in the case. Indeed Professor Jones accepted that it was a “fair summation” to suggest that his expertise did not enable him to say that one explanation for the armed men’s conduct in boarding the vessel was to be preferred to another explanation. As a result I concluded that his evidence could not give the court any reliable assistance on the question whether it was plausible or likely that those who boarded the vessel did so with the intent of hijacking it for ransom.

That said, it does not follow that the court must accept her views. The answer to the question, is it plausible or likely that Yemeni coast guards would decide to hijack a vessel for ransom, depends, in part, upon matters upon which Dr. Lewis could not give evidence, for example, the nature and degree of risks in hijacking (though she was able to refer to statistical data as to the number of young Somalis who died as a result of involvement in piracy).    </p>

Mr. Lillie presented an opinion that a fire main containing sea water was heated by the fire to such an extent that it exploded (a phenomenon known as a BLEVE), thereby propelling an item of equipment across the purifier room so that </p>

<content>
<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">(after avoiding other structures) it struck a bulkhead and fell onto the drain cock thereby damaging it. But very shortly before he was due to give oral evidence Mr. Lillie withdrew his opinion as an explanation for the damage to the drain cock and on Day 35 of the trial the theory was abandoned by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>. The fact that Mr. Lillie was able to present an opinion on an important part of the case and then withdraw it, shortly before he was to give evidence, suggested that the court should be wary of relying upon his opinions. One of the reasons why the theory did not work was that the pipe in question was not a fire main containing water. This mistake suggested (at the very least) that he was prepared to put forward a theory without exercising sufficient care over its basic foundations. In his oral evidence he said that it was probably a fuel oil pipe but nevertheless maintained his opinion that it was possible that it could have exploded with damaging consequences to equipment in the purifier room. I was surprised that he was prepared to express a positive view to that effect in the witness box without having addressed in any detail whether the theory worked with fuel oil rather than with sea water. It suggested to me a somewhat cavalier attitude to his duty to the court.  Indeed, when the fire experts came to address the theory one had never heard of “a fuel oil BLEVE” and the other was not aware of “any authenticated incident of a BLEVE type incident having occurred that had involved HFO”. With regard to other damage in the purifier room, namely, to pipework associated with the fuel conditioning unit, he expressed the view that this was fire damage and in particular damage at the flange connections “where they would have been either brazed or welded”. But in cross-examination he accepted that they would not have been brazed or welded. This again suggested that he was prepared to express views without having exercised sufficient care to ensure that they were correct.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There were however reasons to be cautious when deciding whether to accept his views where they were in issue. First, he made mistakes in his reports. For example, in one of his later reports he expressed the view that it was possible that heavy fuel released from piping damaged by the explosion of the IEID had provided additional fuel for the fire thereby enabling the fire to spread from the purifier room. This was not a tenable opinion in circumstances where in one of his earlier reports he had made clear that the piping had not been damaged by the explosion. Although he himself withdrew his opinion at the start of his evidence in chief it was troubling that he had not checked this matter, or had overlooked it, when writing his later report.  Second, he expressed opinions which he could not maintain. For example, in one of his later reports he described a tap (said by Mr. Lillie to have been fitted to the vessel during the course of <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s life to a diesel oil line) as accessible to an intruder and so a possible source of the accelerant required by the IEID. However, when asked to examine whether and how an intruder would appreciate that the tap was a diesel oil tap, he accepted that the tap could not fairly be described as accessible. This suggested that he did not always give adequate thought to the opinions he expressed. That suggestion was also supported by a number of errors which he made in his comments upon the cause of damage to the Fuel Conditioning Unit and the Boiler Supply Unit. However, in defence of Dr. Mitcheson this was a complex matter and technical experts from time to time make mistakes of detail.  </p>

It would have been preferable had he made clear what questions he had been asked by the solicitors and had also made clear in his answers what matters were supported by evidence and what were not.

They were quite striking. Thus, in the salvage arbitration he described the fire at 0730 on 6 July as residual or diminishing (he agreed with counsel that he was in effect saying it was on its way out) but in this action he described it as very active. In his early report and in the joint report he accepted that the fire in the purifier room had resurged in the afternoon of 6 July but in his later reports he said that the resurgence had not been in the purifier room.   </p>

But in response to counsel he accepted that “any objective reader is getting a totally different picture.” My own view is that the description of a “very active” fire paints a different picture from a description of a fire as residual or diminishing, though such a fire is still “active” because it has not yet gone out. The explanation for what counsel called “the change in tone” was, I think, that Dr. Mitcheson, as a result of his discussions with <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s solicitors, sub-consciously used language which, although in his view technically correct, favoured <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case.      </p>

I was surprised to read these criticisms of his evidence. They stem from the fact that Dr. Craggs revisited the photographs of the purifier room to see if there was evidence of deliberate damage as suggested by Mr. Theodorou. I see nothing sinister or culpable in that. It is true that he had himself inspected the purifier room in 2011 and had not observed any deliberate damage. But then he had not been instructed to look for deliberate damage, apart from gunfire or the use of grenades. Moreover, there is now no dispute that the photographs <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> reveal evidence of damage to the drain cock to the diesel oil tank.

There was support for that view in that in his report he had omitted to mention that the armed men in the small boat had their faces covered, a fact which he admitted would cause him concern. However, I formed the view that it would be unfair to criticise him in that regard. He had formed a clear view as to what was apparent from the VDR audio record, namely, that those on the bridge were not concerned at the approach of the boat. That view may be right or wrong but it formed the context in which he expressed his opinion. Whilst he ought to have mentioned and taken into account that the armed men had their faces covered I did not regard his omission to mention that fact (or other matters relating to the approach of the small boat) as indicative of a lack of an objective approach. He had a common sense view about <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr>. What mattered, in his opinion, was whether practical steps to combat the risk of piracy had been taken rather than whether or not there had been compliance with the letter of <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr>.

That is correct but it was not explained why that mattered. Counsel also said that Captain Cleaver’s experience was limited. That is true but his experience did concern four transits through <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> in 2011. That experience was relevant both as to time and place. It was said, almost as a matter of criticism, that his experience was gained whilst employed on two VLCCs owned by a “global blue chip maritime conglomerate”. I did not regard that as a matter of criticism. It was relevant experience. His approach was said to be “purist” or “doctrinaire” and “a counsel of perfection”. He certainly considered it important to comply with the requirements of <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3. I did not consider it possible to dismiss his opinions on grounds such as this. Rather, his opinion on particular matters, like the opinion of Mr. Hussey on the same matters, had to be carefully assessed and weighed.  </p>

He accepted (and had accepted in his reports) that he was not an expert in the tanker market. Nevertheless he made investigations on the internet and on the basis of what he described as his extensive research expressed views about the tanker market and how it was perceived in and after 2011. I found that surprising. He ought to have appreciated that the tanker market was not within his expertise and declined to express any view about the subject. I therefore thought that it was possible that he was prepared to express opinions which were outside his area of expertise but which advanced the Underwriters’ case.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There was an issue between the parties as to whether the crew of BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO had stolen cargo whilst the vessel was taking bunkers in Jeddah on 3 July 2011.  This was not an issue at the heart of this case. The Underwriters relied upon the alleged theft as evidence of dishonest conduct by those on board the vessel and invited the court to take that into account when considering their principal allegation of scuttling. I was always doubtful that this allegation, if proved, would have more than peripheral relevance to the main issue in the case and thought that it was most unlikely to be determinative of the main issue. The Bank nevertheless wished to disprove the allegation of theft because, if they did so, it would damage the credibility of able seaman Marquez who had not only made the allegation but had also alleged that threats had been made against him were he to tell the truth about the alleged attack by pirates. Again, in circumstances where the reliance that could be placed on the able seaman’s evidence was already limited because he had not been called to give evidence, I was doubtful that the time and cost spent on the expert evidence required to disprove the allegation was justified.  </p>

Mr. Severn (for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>) accepted that the loading and discharge figures at Kerch and Khor Fokkan respectively showed an apparent loss of cargo and an apparent increase in the volume of salt water in the relevant cargo tanks. He accepted that the circumstances in which </p>

<content>
<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">the vessel had been loaded showed that his initial suggestion that the saltwater had been loaded with the cargo was unlikely and unrealistic. He further accepted that an accidental loss of cargo and admixture of saltwater could be ruled out. Thus there was evidence that cargo had been stolen and that saltwater had been added to mask the theft. However, he pointed out that the reported findings at Sharjah (to where the vessel had first been towed) suggested that the theft had not occurred by the time of <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s arrival at Sharjah and so had not occurred at Jeddah on 3 July as alleged by Mr. Marquez. But Mr. Severn accepted that it was difficult to see when the theft could have occurred between <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s stay off Sharjah and her arrival at Khor Fakkan where the STS operation took place and the surveys indicated a cargo loss and an increase in saltwater. He further expressed the opinion that what he described as the “intimate admixture” of the saltwater in the cargo, by which he meant that the saltwater found at Khor Fakkan was not in a separate layer at the bottom of the tank but was mixed with the cargo at all levels, was difficult to explain if the theft had occurred at Jeddah (or indeed later between Sharjah and Khor Fakkan).  In response to my suggestion that “the puzzle is to make all of the figures fit together”, he replied that “it is banging a square peg into a round hole. It is very difficult.” The view that I provisionally formed at the end of his evidence was that his expert evidence had not established that Mr. Marquez’ evidence of cargo theft at Jeddah must be untrue.   </p>

With regard to the “intimate admixture” of saltwater his opinion was that the saltwater could only have been introduced by use of the COW machines and that such method of introduction would explain the “intimate admixture” found at Khor Fokkan. The view that I provisionally formed at the end of his evidence was that his expert evidence had not established that Marquez’ evidence of cargo theft at Jeddah must be true. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In view of the peripheral importance of this issue I shall express my conclusion shortly without rehearsing the sometimes elaborate twists and turns of the opposing arguments. My conclusion is that on the balance of probabilities there was a theft of cargo at Jeddah, essentially for these reasons. (i) If the Sharjah readings are reliable the theft must have occurred after Sharjah. But it is very difficult to envisage how the theft took place after the Sharjah readings were taken. It would involve Five Oceans Salvage and the owners of the vessel into which the cargo had been transhipped being complicit in the theft. Further, it would have to be done without the various surveyors noticing what was going on. After the cargo was stolen seawater would have to be introduced into the relevant tanks. Again, this would have to be done without anyone noticing. In those circumstances it is more probable than not that the Sharjah readings were not correct and therefore they do not stand in the way of a conclusion that there was a theft before Sharjah. (ii) The discharge figures show that saltwater was comingled with the cargo. Although there are dangers in using COW machines to introduce seawater into a tank of fuel oil, as noted by Mr. Severn, I accept Mr. </p>
</content>
</paragraph>
<level>
<content>
<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Minton’s evidence that that was the only means of introducing seawater into the tanks. Since seawater was introduced, COW machines must have been used to introduce the seawater. I further accept Mr. Minton’s evidence that the use of such machines explains the comingling of seawater and cargo found on discharge. (iii) There is no reason to suggest that Mr. Marquez, when he made his allegation of a theft of cargo, was aware of what the loading and discharge figures suggested. It would be an unlikely coincidence that he made an untrue allegation of theft in circumstances where the loading and discharge figures, unknown to him, suggested that such a theft had indeed taken place. Notwithstanding the errors in his recollection of ullages and his failure to identify in terms that the COW machines were used, it is more likely than not that his account of a theft of cargo, followed by the introduction of seawater, was true in general terms. Having said that, I do not consider that this particular episode assists me in determining whether the vessel was scuttled or not.   </p>

The broker said “Vessel is expected to arrive OPL at 21.00 hours tonight in order to remain at anchorage until arrival and embarkation of the security team anticipated AM on the 6th July.

He had not addressed the agent in those terms when they spoke earlier.

Unless that was the speed of the current she would appear to have still been making way though the water, not strictly “drifting”.  Her engines had only been stopped at 2032.

At 2110 the engines were put to slow ahead and the helmsman was instructed to steer 160 degrees. The plotted positions from the VDR indicate that the vessel did indeed move in accordance with those instructions. By 2130 her heading was 162 degrees. Also at 2130 there was a reference to “finish with engine” from which it is apparent that the engines were stopped. By 2200 <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s speed over the ground was, according to the VDR, less than a knot. So it appears that the vessel was now drifting in a north easterly direction, according to the positions plotted from the VDR. She was just outside the Yemeni 12 mile limit, according to the plot derived from the VDR data.  Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that her position was to the north and east of her “initial drifting location” at 2030 (see paragraph 300(3) of their closing submissions). However, the course track prepared from the VDR data shows the vessel, when she was drifting at less than a knot at 2200, to be south and east of her position at 2030. The course track does not identify precisely where the vessel was on the track at 2043 but her position at that time must certainly have been to the north (and west) of the position at which she was drifting at 2200. I consider it more likely than not that the master’s third explanation for the phrase “north of the position” in the call at 2043, namely, the place where he intended to drift, was correct. For after the call he proceeded in a south easterly direction to a position where he commenced to drift.    </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">What is clear from the VDR audio record is that the armed men did not announce themselves to be “the authorities” (as stated in almost all of the witness statements made before hearing the VDR audio record) but announced themselves to be “security”. The VDR audio record is obviously the best evidence. The next most contemporaneous evidence is what has been described as the naval log. That is a document prepared from “raw Centrix data”. The Centrix system is a secure classified system developed by the US Navy which shows date and time stamped information fed into the system from a number of different “chat-rooms”. The document used in this case has, it appears, been drawn from that recorded information.  A report timed at 0812 on 6 July from USS PHILIPPINE SEA records that “the attackers were dressed like military members and claimed to be from <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s agent and were tasked with providing them security for their transit. That was how they were able to get alongside without much alarm.” That information can only have come from the crew of the vessel. The full text of the entry refers to the chief engineer and the master from which it can be inferred that the information came from them, which is in accordance with the probabilities. Thus the VDR audio record and the naval log tell the same consistent story. Although there are later statements made by the crew in Aden and Manila in 2011 to the effect that the armed men were thought to be “the authorities” I have no doubt that such evidence is to be rejected. Most of those statements were retracted when the VDR audio record became available in 2015. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> held fast in their closing submissions to the later statements made in Aden and Manila but, as will be apparent when these statements are discussed below, it is more probable than not that the crew gave such evidence, not because it was true, but because they had been requested to do so. In any event, the VDR record and the near contemporaneous naval log are to be preferred.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> also sought in their closing submissions to make the master’s oral evidence (that he understood the armed men to be “the authorities”) fit with the evidence from the VDR audio record. They did so by suggesting that the master made an “innocent mistake”. It was suggested that he ignored what he was told by Mr. Artezuela, believing that he could not be right in saying the armed men were security and/or paid insufficient attention to what he was being told and/or misheard what he expected to hear, namely, that they were the authorities (see paragraph 324 of their closing submissions; and paragraphs 326-328 for the elaborate justification for the submission).  The difficulty with this submission is that the master’s oral evidence cannot stand with the statement he made in the light of the VDR. In his 2015 statement he noted the references in the VDR to security and that “there is no mention [in the VDR] at all to the men purporting to be from the ‘authorities’. All discussions centre on the men claiming to be from ‘security’ ”. In his 2018 statement he said that “it was only when I was told that it’s the security by Second Officer Artezuela that I thought I needed to lower the pilot ladder and gave that order”.  Yet in his oral evidence he said that Mr. Artezuela “got mistaken in his belief. His belief is security, but my belief is authorities”. The fact that he gave evidence contrary to his most recent statements made in the light of the VDR indicates, in my judgment, that he had decided that he had to support the case that he thought the armed men were the authorities notwithstanding (a) his recognition, when he had the benefit of the VDR, </p>

Furthermore, the naval log recorded that the demand for money was made when the pirates became angry “when the engines would not start”. This does not place the demand for money as early as the later report of 14 July but, in any event, is untrue. The engines were only stopped after the demand for money (see below).

The master in his oral evidence accepted this and that it was he who had opened the safe. The master had said that the crew’s passports were kept in the safe but he also said that when the safe was opened there was only medicine inside. When cross-examined he said the passports were on his table. He said there was a box for that, not “a safety box”. It is probable that the passports were, as the master initially said, kept in the safe. That would be a sensible practice. I am unable to accept his evidence when cross-examined that they were kept in a box on his table ready to show to the authorities (notwithstanding counsel’s comment that his evidence was given in “an unreflexive and spontaneous manner” (see paragraph 343 of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing)). It seems clear on the master’s evidence that they were not in the safe when it was opened. The inevitable inference is that they had been removed from the safe earlier. There is no evidence that the master had been expecting a visit from “the authorities” and so that cannot have been the reason for removing them from the safe.     </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The case of the Underwriters is that what is heard on the bridge when the master and intruders were present is in the nature of a charade. The case for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> is that the events depicted were real. Thus with regard to the events concerning the safe and the stopping of the engines counsel relied upon the oddity of the events as a badge of truth.  “The greater likelihood is that the oddity of the events instead demonstrates their truthfulness” (see paragraph 338 of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing). The events depicted were certainly odd. The instruction “move to Somalia”, being unspecific as to location or course, is an unlikely command from a Yemeni coastguard (even if he had earlier pointed to a destination on the working chart). Similarly, one of the intruders asks “now on the map where is Somalia ?” It is unlikely that a Yemeni coastguard needed assistance to see where Somalia was on the chart. The firing of shots on the bridge coupled with the statement “When you play I shoot you ah?” suggests an attempt to make things sound or look real. There does not appear to have been any particular reason to discharge a gun on the bridge. The use of a Somali word by a Yemeni coastguard is suggestive of a charade. Similarly, the request for the safe and the question whether there was any money after the intruders had been on board for over two hours are difficult to explain. And throughout all of this the vessel was not proceeding to Somalia as apparently instructed, but in the opposite direction, without complaint.  Whether the oddity of these events indicates their truthfulness or whether they were a charade can only be determined after the evidence has been considered as a whole.  </p>

It was also suggested that the chief engineer was not feigning when he required a break from cross-examination because he found it upsetting to be asked about the pirates leading him to the engine room. Counsel submitted that “the impression was that these men were telling the truth” (see paragraph 334).  Findings in a case such as this cannot be based on an impression. Any conclusion as to whether they were telling the truth can only be based upon all the evidence in the case and, in particular, the probabilities.

This strongly suggests that the chief engineer slowed and stopped the main engine. The marine engineering expert witnesses agreed that it was likely that the first movement evidenced by the audio VDR record was half ahead. If so then it is likely, as the master accepted, that the second, third and fourth movements were slow ahead, dead slow ahead and stop. Indeed, when pressed on this Mr. Lillie accepted that there was no alternative explanation. Having operated the fuel lever in the engine control room to execute the desired engine movements the chief engineer then informed the bridge what he had done by moving the engine telegraph accordingly. The master accepted when crossexamined that this was likely. Moving the telegraph on the bridge (by the master) to accord with the movement initiated by the chief engineer caused the buzzer to stop sounding, as the expert marine engineers (and, eventually, the chief engineer) agreed.  Each buzzer sounded for just a second or two on the bridge, consistent with the master having promptly moved the telegraph. </p>

In a “transnational maritime update” dated 6 July 2011 issued by the US Navy it was reported that in interview the chief engineer said that he “attempted to disable the ship by repeatedly starting and stopping the engine to disrupt the airflow and prevent the pirates from gaining command of an operating vessel”.

In a statement made in Aden on 10 July 2011 he said that the main engine turbo charger surged and “I slow down the m/e and stopped”. In a further statement dated 14 July 2011 (which appears to be derived from the statement dated 10 July) he said that after the main engine turbo charger surged “I slowed down the main engine and stopped it.” In his Manila statement (September 2011) he again said that he slowed and stopped the engine in response to the turbocharger continuing to surge. He specifically recalled reducing the rpm to 60 rpm and then to 44 rpm which it was accepted were the rpm for half ahead and slow ahead. In his 2015 statement he retracted this evidence and said, as he did in his oral evidence, that the main engine stopped itself. The evidence from the VDR strongly suggests that the chief engineer slowed and stopped the main engine by reducing the main engine to half ahead, slow ahead, dead slow and stop.

(The explanation for the speed beginning to fall before 0226, when the telegraph indicated half ahead, must be that the chief engineer operated the fuel lever before 0226.) After 0228 the speed over the ground falls at a more rapid rate which is consistent with the engines having been slowed and stopped. In my judgment the VDR record of the speed over the ground is inconsistent with the main engine having stopped at 0224.5. </p>

The expert marine engineers agreed that turbocharging surging does not cause a main engine to stop. It might indicate an underlying malfunction (such as the failure of a scavenge non-return valve or a governor malfunction) but if it did there should have been previous indications. There had been, as the marine engineering experts agreed, no prior history of main engine problems apart from intermittent turbocharger surging and the main engine had run normally for over an hour before it stopped. Further, it was agreed that the right thing to do when there is turbocharger surging is to make a slight adjustment of revs up or down, though ultimately, if that did not work the engine would have to be stopped. A typical or obvious response would be to keep the main engine running, rather than slow it down.   </p>

This possibility had been mentioned by Mr. Lillie in one of his later reports when he suggested that the chief engineer may have “inadvertently slowed the engine to a point where it stalled”. However, there was much sense in Mr. Gibson’s evidence that in circumstances where the chief engineer was required to keep the engine running, “to slow the Vessel right down and possibly risk stalling the engine makes no sense at all”. An inadvertent stalling was not mentioned expressly during the oral evidence of the marine engineering experts. It is possible that Mr. Lillie had it in mind when he said that the chief engineer “continued trying it. And then perhaps it got out of hand from him. I don’t know.” But the VDR audio record shows that the chef engineer must have signalled 4 engine movements to the bridge. That is very difficult to fit with “adjustments” getting out of hand.  I prefer and accept the view of Mr. Gibson that inadvertent stalling is not realistic. The chief engineer has never suggested that he had inadvertently stalled the main engine.  </p>

Thus the suggestion of a malfunction was no more than a possibility unsupported by evidence. Reliance was placed on what was said to be an alarm which sounded on the bridge at 0225 just before the first engine movement. However, it was not clearly an alarm; the Underwriters referred to it as an “unidentified sound”. If there had been a main engine alarm it would have sounded in the engine room and the chief engineer had no recollection of such an alarm. If there had been one, just before the first engine movement, it is likely that he would have remembered it, given the effect which, on his account, the stopping of the engines had had on the armed men. </p>

Reliance was placed on a general comment by a marine adviser in connection with the STS operation but he said nothing specifically about main engine problems. Reference was also made to cooling system problems in May 2011 and to evidence of ongoing maintenance.

A series of questions was asked: “Why stop?”, “where is Somalia?”. The Underwriters say that this was a further charade, noting that the questions were asked after the final engine movement and not after any of the previous engine movements. The Bank say (see paragraph 445 of its closing) that “the angry outburst ….has the aura of reality”. The audio record was played in court. Whilst the intruder’s voice appears to be shouting it is impossible to tell merely from listening to the recording whether this was a genuine series of questions or a charade. Shortly afterwards, before 0229, a phone rang on the bridge. The master assumed this was the chief engineer and the chief engineer thought that was possible though he had no recollection of ringing the bridge. It is unlikely to have been anyone else. There does not appear to be any audio record of what was said.  The Underwriters say this call was “part of a co-ordinated process between the master and chief engineer to stop the vessel and prepare to set off the explosive device.” Whatever was said by the chief engineer on the phone would not be recorded on the bridge and there is no audio record of what the master said. The Bank suggests that there could in this call have been an instruction from the intruder on the bridge to the intruders in the engine room “to make an attempt to restart the main engine, failing which a fire should be started”. But such an instruction would have been recorded and it was not. In any event this suggestion ignores the probability that it was the chief engineer who called. </p>

When plotted this shows the vessel turning almost a complete circle by 0310. In his 2011 statements the master makes no reference to this dramatic change in course. In his 2015 statement, after the VDR had been studied, he noted the turn. He said that he did not turn the vessel and suggested that “the vessel turned hard to starboard …because <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s speed dropped off: the autopilot struggles to hold <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s course at slower speeds.”  But by 0230 <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s speed was still in excess of 9 knots, yet the course made good was changing to starboard. By 0230 it was about 300 degrees and was continuing to turn. The master’s explanation is unlikely to be correct. As Mr. Gibson said, this was “not loss of steerage due to lack of way”. The autopilot would have “no problem keeping the course at speeds of ….6 knots or above.” Mr. Gibson’s experience of such matters came from sea trials “doing specifically this, doing turns and seeing how the engines perform, seeing at what point you lose steerage.” His view accords with my understanding of these matters (derived from collision cases). It seems to me much more likely than not that the substantial change of heading was the result of helm action by the master. There is no other realistic explanation. Equally unlikely is the master’s evidence that the “pirates did not notice the ship turning at the time”.   Given that they were members of the Yemeni coast guard or navy those on the bridge surely cannot have missed it. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a dispute as to whether in fact the chief engineer sought to escape from the armed men. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> have submitted (see paragraphs 419-440) that his account is credible. The case of the Underwriters is that he did not seek to escape and instead acted in collaboration with the armed men. Whether that case can be proved depends upon an assessment of the evidence as a whole. At present the most that I can say is that the chief engineer’s account of escaping from the intruders and then hiding from them between the sewage tank and the sewage treatment unit is improbable. First, the chief engineer was at risk of being seen coming out of the aft door of the purifier room. He said he could not be seen. But the photograph of this part of the third deck from the second deck suggests that he could be seen coming out of the aft door of the purifier room. He suggested that there were spare parts and/or trunking which would hide him. But if he walked (even if moved, as he said, “very fast”) into the suggested hiding place from the purifier room it seems to me to be likely that he could be seen. In order to see him the armed men would have had to move to the starboard side of the second deck. It is not inevitable that they would do so but the chief engineer would have to take the risk that they did not. Second, it seems to me to have been a very dangerous place for a person, who feared being shot by the intruders, to hide. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> could only say that the hiding place gave a “certain amount of cover.” (The chief engineer had said in his 2015 statement that he could see the mouths of the pirates moving. If so then it is likely that they could see him. But he denied in his oral evidence that he could see the mouths of the pirates and yet could not explain why he had said that in 2015.) If the armed men had looked for him they would have found him. They would wish to find him because, on his account, they wanted him to restart the main engine. The chief engineer was unable to explain why they had not found him. If they had found him there was no escape from them. Third, if he had been intent on escaping he could have descended to the turbine deck (where he would not be visible) and made his way to the “citadel” in the steering gear room via the emergency escape trunk. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> said that this would have been more dangerous. But I was not persuaded that this was so. It involves the chief engineer disappearing from view, but just as he signalled to the armed men that he wished to enter the purifier room (and so disappear from view) so he could signal that he wished to go to the turbine deck (and so disappear from view). The advantage of the latter is that he could reach the citadel. That would be safer than his hiding place behind the sewage tank.  </p>

Mr. Vergos gave evidence in the salvage arbitration that he became aware of the need for assistance at about 0330 and that a salvage tug and an anti-pollution vessel (together with a salvage team of 14) were mobilised and on their way to the casualty by 0400. The salvage experts agreed that this was “an unusually rapid response time”. Captain Stirling thought this “almost impossible”, a view with which I, based upon my experience of salvage cases, can readily sympathise. It is possible that there is some exaggeration in Mr. Vergos’ account and indeed it is <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case that the salvage vessels departed for the casualty at about 0500. In circumstances where there can be no real doubt that the craft were on site by shortly after 0723 (see below) and where the experts considered that the voyage out would have taken about 2.5 hours to reach the casualty, Poseidon may not have left until nearer 0450.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">But quite when Poseidon were informed of the casualty is not clear. Mr. Vergos claimed in his salvage statement that he learnt of the casualty at about 0330 but he also said that he was informed that the vessel had been abandoned, which event did not occur until about 0412. He said that that he was informed by <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s local agents and directly from the Owner’s office in Greece. There is no other evidence of a communication from the local agents and the Owners’ email communication was later, at 0421, when they instructed Poseidon by email to proceed immediately to the vessel (which was said to be “in distress”) and offer their best services. This unparticularised description of the casualty as “in distress” suggests that the person sending it must have known that Poseidon already knew of the nature of the casualty. So the Owner’s office may well have contacted Mr. Vergos before 0421. However, in view of the unreliability of Mr. Vergos’ evidence (something which is common ground) his suggested time of 0330 can only be accepted if it is supported by other reliable evidence. As I have noted, his departure time of 0400 is not accepted by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> to be correct and is before the vessel was abandoned. No clear assistance as to times is provided by the written evidence of Mr. Pappas of FOS. In his salvage statement he said that after he had been informed of the casualty by Mr. Iliopoulos “at around 0300 or 0400” Greek time (which I was told was the same as local time in Aden) he had called Mr. Vergos “within an hour or so”. When he spoke to him he learnt that Mr. Vergos was already aware of the casualty from Mr. Iliopoulos and was in the process of mobilising his tug, anti-pollution craft and salvage team<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>Whilst Mr. Pappas’ account is unclear as to precise times it is clear as to the activity of Mr. Iliopoulos in the early hours of 6 July. Not only did he telephone Mr. Pappas but he also telephoned Mr. Vergos. How Mr. Iliopoulos learnt of <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s predicament is unclear. The <abbr title="Ship Security Alert System">SSAS</abbr> alert was sent to Central Mare and so the manager may have informed the Owner.

But such a response time is improbable. The time interval is likely to have been greater. Whatever the time interval was, Poseidon’s response was impressively prompt.     </p>

If this evidence is accepted <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case that there was a genuine attack by pirates could not, I think, survive. It is true that there was a call on VHF channel 16 at 0303 announcing that the vessel was under attack from seven pirates. That is apparent from the VDR audio record. Mr. Plakakis’ recollection of the call (“Help, help, help, help BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO, Pirates”) does not match the VDR audio record, though the call implicitly sought help from USS PHILIPPINE SEA.

The photographs also showed smoke from aft of the accommodation. There was a dispute between the fire experts as to whether it showed, in addition to smoke from the louvres in the chimney casing, smoke rising up from the alleyway between the accommodation and the engine room casing.  Dr. Mitcheson thought that it did but Dr. Craggs thought that it did not. Dr. Craggs thought that the smoke forward of the engine casing had come from aft of the funnel where smoke was emerging from a door. Neither expert’s view is without difficulty. Dr. Mitcheson’s view faces the difficulty that the smoke in question does not appear to be connected to a plume of smoke coming up from the alleyway. Dr. Craggs’ view faces the difficulty that he could not explain how, in conditions of no wind, the smoke from aft made its way forward around the funnel casing. I am inclined to think that the difficulty facing Dr. Craggs’ view is the more difficult to overcome.

It shows that the fire was probably in decline. When Dr. Mitcheson commented upon this photograph in the salvage proceedings he said that he was of the view that the fire “had clearly and evidently decayed significantly”.

The unsigned salvage report which may have been prepared no earlier than 22 July reports flames from the accommodation at 0700. But flames are not evidenced in the photographs. Dr. Mitcheson said when crossexamined that “there was no sign in the photograph that I had that seemed to be contemporaneous with the arrival of the salvage tug that there was a large fire raging or present within the accommodation block.”   The fire experts agreed that there can be a fire in the accommodation without there being overt signs of it. But the fact remains that there is no evidence of a substantial fire when Poseidon arrived on site. Given that the photographs reveal no evidence of a fire in the accommodation it is more likely than not that Mr. Vergos’ statement and the unsigned salvage report are untrue in that respect.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Dr. Mitcheson considered that in a photograph taken at 0901 smoke can be seen coming from the accommodation. Dr Craggs disagreed that the “mistiness” is smoke. He said that it is spray caused by the tug’s monitor. There is a similar dispute as to a photograph taken at 0902. Doing my best to examine the photographs Dr. Craggs’ view is open to the criticism that the spray from the monitor appears to be somewhat aft of the “smoke” seen by Dr. Mitcheson. A better point is perhaps that the “smoke” cannot be seen in a photograph taken at about the same time. This would suggest that what Dr. Mitcheson saw was not smoke. On the other hand, the location of the “smoke” is in the same position in which smoke can, or can arguably be seen, later in the morning at 1230 (see below). My conclusion is that it is possible that there was smoke from the accommodation but that I cannot make a finding that there was. If there was, any fire in the accommodation at this time must have been very minor in nature. Dr. Mitcheson accepted that the smoke observed by him was “minor” and suggestive of “a very small fire”.      </p>

During this time the smoke from the funnel appears to have diminished yet further. There is, in addition, smoke from the tug and spray from the tug’s monitor. The fire experts are in dispute as to what areas of “mistiness” on the photographs indicate. Dr. Craggs’ preferred view is that the fire was out by 1030 and that only tug smoke or spray from the monitor can be seen. But in his oral evidence he accepted that it was possible that what can (just) be seen is smoke from the vessel and in his written evidence he said that whilst most combustible material in way of the fire had been consumed it was possible that there were “some smouldering residues of, for example, wooden boxes in the Stores”. Dr. Mitcheson’s view is that the engine room fire was still “active”. However, the evidence of “smoke” from the funnel cannot be described as compelling. In his oral evidence Dr. Mitcheson referred to the evidence of smoke as being “subtle”, “not conspicuous” and to there being a “hint of smoke”.  </p>

My finding therefore is that by the time of the last photograph in this sequence at 1028 the fire had almost gone out and that it would shortly go out. The salvage experts agreed that the cooling carried out by the salvors was unlikely to have had any significant beneficial effect on fighting the fire. As is often the case the fire was burning itself out because it had consumed the fuel in its path. </p>

Dr. Mitcheson said that he had “sympathy” with that view. It seems more likely than not that the smoke emanated from the tug which was back on the portside of the vessel.

Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that “there remain unexplained aspects to the fire” and that “the fire at 1030 appears rather more active” (see paragraph 566 of their closing submissions).

However, there appears to be force and sense in the submission by counsel for the Underwriters that this does not detract from the agreement between the fire experts that the fire had run out of oil and was clearly going out.

By 1000, according to the naval log, the master, chief engineer and an electrician were on their way back to the vessel “to assess the situation”. When cross-examined the master was asked whether he boarded BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO that morning. He replied “yeah” but added that the master of the tug did not allow them to board the vessel “because still fire risk….still smoke ….it’s dangerous.” I do not think that the fair conclusion to draw from his reply is that he agreed that he re-boarded and then changed his mind. Rather, he noted the question and then gave his answer that he did not re-board. However, I find this evidence (and that of the chief engineer to the same effect) difficult to accept. The salvage team had boarded the vessel earlier and since then the fire had continued to decay and was on its way out. The means to board the vessel was a pilot ladder on the starboard side towards the stern and a pilot ladder on the portside much further forward towards the bow. It is more likely than not that it was not dangerous to board the vessel. There does not appear to have been any convincing reason for the master and chief engineer not to re-board the casualty.  </p>

Dr. Craggs agreed that the photographs showed a substantial and active fire. Further, in his opinion, which I accept, the final photograph in this sequence at 1239 shows that the quantity of smoke emanating from the Vessel had increased considerably suggesting that the fire was developing fairly rapidly.</p>

In the light of his disagreement with Dr. Mitcheson as to what can be seen at 0900, Dr. Craggs did not accept that the later photograph showed anything other than that at about 1230 there was fire in the accommodation. I have accepted that it is possible that that there was smoke emanating from the accommodation at 0900. It is therefore possible that by 1230 a very minor fire in the accommodation at 0900 had increased in size somewhat, but not much, as a result of the heat generated by the now substantial and active fire in the engine room. If the (possible) very minor fire in the accommodation had gone out it may have been reignited by the now substantial fire in the engine room.        </p>

It is unnecessary to recount the reasons put forward by Dr. Mitcheson for this change of opinion. They did not stand up to cross-examination and Dr. Mitcheson eventually accepted that the resurgence was likely to have occurred in the purifier room “on the basis of the availability of fuel”.

Essentially, the point put was that the absence of smoke above the cross-alley suggested there was no fire in the purifier room. If there had been such a fire smoke would have exited into the cross-alley via the engine room skylight and the mushroom vent. Thus it was submitted that by a “process of elimination” a fire in the purifier room could be ruled out (see paragraph 588 of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing). Dr. Craggs did not accept this because the skylight may have been acting as an air inlet (as hot gases exited though the funnel) and the mushroom vent may have been closed (because the mechanism for forcing air through it was likely at some stage to have been damaged by the fire). Thus the absence of smoke did not necessarily indicate that there was no fire in the purifier room. </p>

Third, Dr. Mitcheson accepted that the closure of the mushroom vent was possible and therefore could explain the absence of smoke.

Counsel are of course entitled to rely upon evidence from Dr. Craggs when cross-examined and upon the evidence of Captain Stirling, the Underwriters’ salvage expert, when crossexamined, but where counsel’s detailed argument, spanning many paragraphs, as to the location of the resurgence is not to be found in the evidence from <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s own fire expert, the court is entitled to entertain doubt as to the argument put forward by counsel.</p>

But counsel for the Underwriters pointed out that the flames and hot gases from the fire could have caused the fire to spread in the absence of combustible material by means of conduction or convection. There was, for example, as stated by Dr. Mitcheson, an airlock access in the forward port corner which opened out into the base of the accommodation stairwell which would allow flames and hot gases to enter the accommodation.

The Bank called the chief engineer but did not elicit evidence from him to support this suggestion. It was not investigated with the marine engineering experts or with the fire experts. No particulars of the suggestion were given, as to where the oil was stored, why it was stored, or why it survived the initial fire but was then released to cause the resurgence of the fire.

The question is whether it occurred naturally or because of human intervention. (The term “resurgence” was used throughout the trial. It was not intended to suggest, at least by counsel for the Underwriters, that the first fire had not gone out but was used as a convenient label to describe what was seen at 1230, without prejudging the question whether the first fire had gone out and that what was seen at 1230 was a separate fire.) This important issue can only be resolved after more of the evidence has been considered. For the moment it is only necessary to note two matters. First, there is a surprising absence of photographs between 1030 and 1230 during which time the fire must have resurged. The absence is surprising because it is to be expected that a salvage company would take photographs of important events throughout the course of the salvage service. The resurgence of the fire must have been such an event. Second, a photograph taken on 21 July 2011 reveals that the drain cock to the diesel oil tank in the purifier room was damaged. There is now (in reality) no dispute that such damage was deliberate. If it was damaged deliberately after 1030 and before </p>

Dr. Mitcheson said that by this time the smoke “had largely subsided” but added that “the fire had not extinguished but continued to spread through the accommodation.”   Dr. Craggs considered that the towage may have led to a change in ventilation and hence a change in the appearance of the smoke, although he accepted that the speed of towage was no more than 1 knot.     </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The first point was that the hiring of a security team to board the vessel at Aden was a “ruse” to explain why the vessel was drifting off Aden. The Underwriters’ case, as articulated in the closing submissions at paragraph 479 (and paragraph 428) is that, based upon the evidence of Mr. Plakakis, the ruse was developed after Poseidon’s tug VOUKEFALAS had experienced engine trouble en route to a Turkish vessel in need of salvage services. The Underwriters say that the original plan had been for a fake attack by pirates in the southern Red Sea. The tug’s engine problems meant that “it made sense from this point onwards for the plan to be revised, and for the incident to take place closer to Aden.” By contrast <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s pleaded case was that the security team had been engaged because the charterers had suggested it. However, <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing submissions advanced a more subtle case. The Bank accepted that the Owner rejected the charterers’ suggestion (see paragraph 190) and sometime after doing so “had a change of heart” (see paragraph 195) because it was a “prudent thing to do”. </p>

Further, the engagement of unarmed security made no sense because their function was to help with risk assessment and “hardening” of the vessel, activities which it was too late to conduct off Aden. There is some force in these points. But there is also some force in at least some of the many points made by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> in support of the suggestion that the engagement of the security team was a genuine commercial engagement and against the suggestion that the engagement of the security was a ruse; see paragraphs 172-248 of the closing submissions. I have noted in particular the point that, if it were a ruse, one would have expected the Owners to have accepted the charterers’ suggestion when it was first made (see paragraph 193) and also the point that, if it were a ruse, the Owners were unlikely to have entered into detailed negotiations with Hydrasec over several days (see paragraph 199).

The Underwriters’ submission is that the suggested charade was an attempt to lay a false paper trail to make it look unlikely that a staged attack by pirates at Aden was planned by the Owner. This was based upon the Owner’s email to Anyland on 1 July which showed that the Owner had already decided that the security team would fly to Aden. There is, as counsel accepted, an alternative explanation, namely, that “the right hand” of the Owner did not know what “the left hand” of the Owner was doing. Both explanations are possible and are supported by evidence. I was not persuaded that this was a significant matter. </p>

The Bank has suggested that in consequence the security team were unable to take that flight.

It is surprising that she recalled this matter several years after the event. When informed that there was evidence that the flight had been brought forward and not cancelled she said that the flight might have been reinstated.

However, whether the Owner intended to use that letter to show (untruthfully) that the arrival of the security team had been delayed and that as a result the vessel drifted off Aden for longer than had been intended in order to suggest, if it ever became necessary to do so, that there was an innocent explanation for the vessel drifting off Aden, is an issue which, in order to be determined, must await a consideration of all of the evidence.  </p>

In circumstances where the vessel was drifting in the Gulf of Aden and piracy was feared it is a matter of some surprise that the master, without even leaving his cabin and investigating the matter for himself, authorised the armed men to board the vessel by the pilot ladder. He did so having been told that there had been no call from the boat and that there were 7 persons on board. I would have expected a prudent master to have left his cabin and investigated the matter himself in order to make sure that the armed men in the boat were in fact the security personnel who had come to assist rather than attack the vessel.

Indeed, the master accepted when cross-examined that there were several reasons why they could not have been “security”, notwithstanding that in his 2018 statement he had said that he permitted the armed men to board because they were “security”. His written and oral evidence on this topic was in truth incoherent and invites the conclusion that he permitted the armed men to board because he was part of a conspiracy to permit a group of armed men to board the vessel. There is no other explanation in circumstances where his oral evidence that he believed they were the authorities cannot be accepted. Stupidity or incompetence is in theory another explanation but that seems to me fanciful in circumstances where the risk of piracy was something of which the master was aware.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that it was at least plausible to suggest that the Yemeni coast guard personnel who boarded the vessel were motivated to and did hijack the vessel with a view to trying to sell or trade it to Somali pirates. They relied upon expert evidence that Yemen was a failing state, that the security situation in Yemen had deteriorated in the early part of 2011, that Yemen was one of the poorest countries in the world, that the coastguard had suffered a dramatic budget cut in 2009, that by July 2011 the coastguard had ceased to carry out private security operations, that corruption was endemic in Yemen, and that at least some of the coast guard personnel would have been prepared to use their position to obtain illicit benefits to supplement their income. Pausing there, these circumstances are just as consistent with the Underwriters’ case as they are with <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> further relied upon evidence that the Yemeni coastguard colluded with Somali pirates at the logistical level (the supply of food, fuel and/or weapons) and that there were criminal connections between Somalia and Yemen in legal and illegal trades including weapons, narcotics and people smuggling. Professor Jones considered that “existing patterns of collaboration between Somali pirates and Yemenis could have paved the way for joint piracy operations, in which Yemenis might have acted as the perpetrators of attacks.”  Dr. Lewis disagreed with that hypothesis, “given that (i) the available evidence suggests that any collaboration between Somali pirates and Yemenis was limited and would not naturally lead to joint attacks, (ii) Yemeni involvement in Somali piracy would potentially be unwelcome to Somalis, and (iii) there is no evidence of such joint attacks having occurred.” It seemed to me that Dr. Lewis’ doubts were well founded. Another contentious element in counsel’s argument was the suggestion, based upon Dr. Shortland’s evidence, that the established links between Somali piracy and illicit criminal trades between Yemen and Somalia could plausibly have formed the basis for “the conclusion of a self-enforcing criminal agreement between those who organised the attack on the BV and Somali pirates for the purpose of carrying out a ransom transaction, or an arbitrated enforceable contract based on several channels of informal contract enforcement” (see paragraph 920 of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing). The enforcers of illegal contracts were “clan elders, businessmen and in some areas religious elites, based around clan groups” (see paragraph 922 of </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The expert evidence as to Piracy and Yemeni criminality spawned extensive debate in the written closing arguments; see paragraphs 907-974 of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s closing and paragraphs 704-763 of the Underwriters’ closing. The possibilities canvassed in the evidence and in submissions included the Yemeni coastguard seizing the opportunity to hijack a tanker with a valuable cargo and get it within “the range of a phone mast on the Somali coast” and start “a telephone conversation” with Somali pirates. There was also considered “some sort of transaction agreed in advance of the arrival of the BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO off the East coast of Somalia” with the benefit of “Somali clan protection …providing a guarantee of safe passage”. These suggestions were freely discussed by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s experts and counsel notwithstanding that there was no evidence of Yemeni piracy either before or after the event which befell BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO. This was criticised by counsel for the Underwriters as unwarranted speculation and counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> had to accept that it involved a “degree of conjecture”. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that this was acceptable in circumstances where the experts were in “uncharted territory” and that “the Court must do the best it can, taking into account the actual circumstances of the attack and matters which are properly the subject of expert evidence in the fields of Piracy and Yemeni criminality.” </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this area of wide-ranging speculation and conjecture I consider it helpful to examine “the actual circumstances of the attack”, that is, what happened on board BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO, and in particular the actions of the armed men themselves, and, in the light of such matters, to consider whether it is plausible to suggest that the armed men who boarded BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO had the intention suggested by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>. That seems to me a safer route to a sound conclusion than consideration of the possible scenarios suggested by Dr. Shortland and Professor Jones. That is particularly so given the general observations upon which the Yemeni criminality experts were agreed, namely, that “Yemen is an inherently complex case to study. The fragility of the state in 2011, its poor capacity to collect accurate data on its citizens, and the lack of journalistic freedom in this time period have meant that only general observations can be made about the security situation”. It was agreed that “crime is also inherently difficult to study by virtue of the facts that (i) it is designed to occur undetected and (ii) the availability of reliable data is limited, particularly in Yemen.”   </p>

If these general matters alone had been the cause of the incident, then I would have expected there to be other such attacks, both before and afterwards. There was nothing about the situation in Yemen in July 2011 specifically which was uniquely conducive to the commission of this type of crime.” This seemed to me to be a rational approach and a further reason for concentrating upon “the actual circumstances of the attack”.</p>

When they arrived alongside the vessel shortly before midnight they announced that they were “security”. This was false information but must, on <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case, have been intended to gain them permission to board. The deception, if such it was, was successful, notwithstanding that the security team was supposed to consist of three unarmed men, not seven armed men, and was expected to arrive at 5 am, not at midnight.  The Underwriters ask, rhetorically, how did the armed men know that security were expected by the vessel ? Those who knew of the arrangement for unarmed security guards were the Owner, Hydrasec (the Greek company who provided the security team of three from Greece), and the two agents in Aden who had been informed of the arrangement. However, there is no obvious reason why (assuming the absence of the suggested conspiracy to fake an attack by pirates) any of those persons would have had cause to reveal to the Yemeni coast guard that BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO was expecting “security” and no evidence to suggest that they did. The fact that the armed men knew that “security” was expected is therefore surprising and improbable.   </p>

He could not “reconcile” the possession of an IEID “with the suggestion that they were pirates whose objective was to hijack and trade the vessel.”  But there is a further problem with all of these suggestions (even assuming that they are realistic), namely, that the device the armed men brought was incomplete. It lacked accelerant. That is common ground. If the armed men truly wanted a device for any of the suggested purposes they would surely have brought with them a complete device rather than hope to find an accelerant on board a vessel with which they were not familiar.

It is improbable, as it seems to me, that disaffected members of the Yemeni coast guard on their first foray into piracy would decide to take an IEID without accelerant for use in certain contingencies or as an insurance against certain outcomes. It would suggest that there had been deep and sophisticated thought about the various things which might go wrong (the crew retreating to a citadel, the need to escape and the risks of dealing with Somali pirates – though with regard to the last it is wholly unclear how an IEID would assist). But such sophisticated pre-planning appears quite unlikely in circumstances where the armed men did not plan to bring with them any accelerant and whose instruction to the master was no more sophisticated than “Move to Somalia”.     </p>

The use of an IED is therefore, in my view, fundamentally inconsistent with an explanation of the incident as an act of piracy.” </p>

<content>
<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There is a further point. Given that the decision to activate the IEID must have been made quickly in the period of less than 20 minutes between the stopping of the main engines by the chief engineer and the sounding of the fire alarm, this change of plan from one of hijack to one of punishment or causing a distraction must have been made very quickly. That is surprising and improbable, for at least two reasons. First, given the work and effort presumably put into the hijacking attempt and the anticipated rewards one would not expect the armed men to abandon their suggested plan so quickly. One would expect them to look for the chief engineer (if he had escaped) or seek assistance from one of the other engineers. I note in this regard that Captain Northwood, with his knowledge of piracy, expressed the opinion that “genuine pirates would have been likely to seek to persist in the hijack”. Second, the available time (20 minutes) appears insufficient for all that was necessary, including deciding to give up on the hijacking plan, locating a container in which to put the accelerant, locating the accelerant, putting the accelerant into the container  and activating the accelerant (all in a vessel with which the armed men were unfamiliar). They succeeded in all of this on their own without, on the chief engineer’s evidence, seeking any assistance from him as to where and how to source accelerant. The Bank’s case is that the armed men located diesel oil in the purifier room as an accelerant by means of a tap on a retrofitted diesel oil line. The Underwriters say that the retrofitted line was an air line and in any event would have been difficult for the armed men, being unfamiliar with the engine room, to find. The Bank’s alternative case was that diesel oil could have been located via the diesel oil drain cock. However, the drain cock was fitted with a tundish and so, in the absence of a siphon, was not an obvious means by which to extract diesel oil from the tank. Thus whichever device was used by the armed men (on <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s case) would take time to be found and/or used.      </p>

Second, there is no obvious reason for the gun shots. Third, the late request for the safe is odd and suggestive of an attempt to appear to be pirates. Fourth, although it must have been apparent to the intruders from 0226 that the main engine was slowing, no question was asked about this until 0228 when the fourth engine telegraph movement indicated that the main engine had been stopped. Fifth, at about the time of the fire alarm an intruder asked the master “are you OK?”.  </p>

This was recognised by Lord Donaldson in his report <span style="font-style:italic">"Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas"</span> (1994) when he recommended that tribunals should, when assessing a salvage award, take particular account of the decline of the salvage industry and ensure that they give sufficient encouragement to dedicated professional salvors; see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Navigator Spirit SA v Five Oceans Salvage SA</span> <ref canonical="[2018] EWHC 1108 (Comm)" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2018/1108" isneutral="true" type="case" year="2018">[2018] EWHC 1108 (Comm)</ref> at paragraph 25.

But since the statement that doors and access ways were closed is untrue it cannot be cogent evidence that there was adequate access. Further, although Mr. Vergos states that the salvage team boarded on the starboard side (and the photographs show a pilot ladder on the starboard side aft of the accommodation) this may also be untrue. The early photographs show the tug on the portside of the casualty near the pilot ladder which was forward, towards the bow.

The photographs around 1000 do not reveal much, if any smoke on the portside and the fire was on its way out. The salvors can be seen to be boundary cooling on the portside at this time which, whilst it did not cause the fire to go out, must have served to cool any hotspots. </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In these circumstances it seems to me that at some stage around 1000 it is more likely than not that the salvors could safely have approached the portside of the accommodation to close the doors and close the vents (which would, on the expert evidence of Captain Stirling, have been visible). Had there been any lingering heat the tug’s monitor could have cooled it. Mr. Herrebout relied upon what he regarded as evidence of smoke from the pump room at this time but, for the reasons I have already given, I do not accept that evidence. In any event, I found Captain Stirling’s opinion on the question of access firm, clear, reasoned and persuasive. Mr. Herrebout said, rightly, that much would depend upon the judgment of the man on the spot, Mr. Vergos. But there is no evidence from Mr. Vergos that such were the conditions of heat and smoke before 1000 that he and his team could not safely access the portside of the accommodation. Captain Stirling had much experience of acting as salvage master and I preferred his evidence on this issue to that of Mr. Herrebout.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The CO2 system could also have been activated from the Fire Control station (or from the CO2 room which was in the alleyway between the accommodation and the engine casing towards the starboard side).  It is not common for salvors to operate a vessel’s CO2 system because the casualty’s crew usually do that or the salvors usually arrive long after CO2 would be effective. Further, the experts agreed that operating the CO2 system was probably outside Poseidon’s expertise if acting alone. But in circumstances where Poseidon were able from about 1000 to get advice and information from the master and chief engineer they would not be acting alone. Moreover, the master and chief engineer are likely to have told Poseidon that they had not activated the CO2 system. In those circumstances my conclusion is that Poseidon could reasonably have been expected to activate the CO2 system in an attempt either to smother what remained of the fire or as a precaution against re-ignition. It is true that in circumstances where all doors, vents and dampers had not been closed the CO2 could not be expected to remain effective for long. But I accept the evidence of Captain Stirling that that is not a reason for not releasing the CO2. I noted <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s reliance on certain fire fighting guides which identify the need to close all doors, vents and dampers but I found Captain Stirling’s reasons for operating the CO2, even if those steps had not been taken, compelling.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The remaining step which it was alleged (in the pleading) that Poseidon failed to take was flooding the accommodation with water so as to create a “horizontal barrier” to the spread of fire into the accommodation. In circumstances where the doors to the accommodation on the portside were open and the engine room fire had very substantially diminished, flooding the accommodation from the tug’s monitor was a means by which the deck between the accommodation and the engine room below could have been cooled and as result the risk of fire spread into the accommodation reduced. I accept Captain Stirling’s evidence that the obvious first step would have been to close the doors to the accommodation but I also accept his evidence that thereafter it would also have been appropriate to open a door in order to flood the accommodation. I accept Mr. Herrebout’s evidence that not all areas of the deck would necessarily be cooled and so the “barrier” would not be complete but the injection of water into the accommodation would serve to cool the deck and so reduce the risk of fire spread as explained by Captain Stirling. Whilst Captain Stirling expressed the opinion that this step ought to have been taken by Poseidon he appeared to accept that, given the doubts as to the efficacy of horizontal cooling, a salvor might reasonably decide to concentrate on boundary cooling. That being so, I am not persuaded that in not injecting water into the accommodation to form a horizontal barrier, Poseidon failed to take a step which they could reasonably have been expected to take.  </p>

The fact that the steps in question were not taken does not establish that Poseidon was party to such a conspiracy. The steps may not have been taken because of incompetence by Poseidon or because Poseidon unjustifiably feared to approach the accommodation or because Poseidon confined its actions to those which had been directed by FOS, namely, boundary cooling. Poseidon was a small local diving and salvage company which was not known to either Mr. Herrebout or Captain Stirling, notwithstanding their knowledge and experience of the savage industry. There is little if any firm evidence of the abilities and experience of Mr. Vergos and his salvage team. At this stage I observe that, if Poseidon were in such a state of readiness for salvage services that they were able to respond as rapidly as they apparently did to the need for salvage services by BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO, it is very surprising that, on arrival at the casualty, they failed to take the steps which would be expected of a competent salvor, notwithstanding (as emphasised by counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>) that they had not been instructed to take those steps by FOS. On the Underwriters’ case the explanation is that the response was not what it seemed and that the obvious steps to fight the fire were deliberately not taken.  </p>

Second, Poseidon were on site but neither the statement of Mr. Vergos nor the unsigned report of Poseidon’s services refer to this resurgence. Yet it must have been a most significant event.

Mr. Lillie said he could not see evidence of re-assembly but Mr. Gibson said he could. My own observation of the photograph agrees with Mr. Gibson. The suggestion of reassembly is also supported by the evidence of Dr. Craggs who operated the lever at the time of his inspection (as recorded in his factual witness statement). He was challenged as to whether he had an actual memory at the time of writing his third expert report in 2018 of the lever returning to its original position. He said that he did. I do not doubt that he gave that evidence in good faith but I am doubtful that he has such a memory, having regard to the passage of time. However, if the lever had not returned to its original position it is likely that he would have noticed that and recorded that in his factual witness statement.  Indeed, he himself said that he thought he would have noted it if it had not returned to its position. It was not noted and so it is more likely than not that the lever did return to its original position. The marine engineers disagreed as to the significance of this but I accept Mr. Gibson’s evidence that it suggests that the lever linkage had been re-assembled. I therefore find that it is more probable than not that the drain cock was reassembled. </p>

There is of course some force in those suggestions.

In those circumstances there must be real doubt as to the reliance that can be placed on his comment that the diesel oil tanks were intact. In his later report dated 19 July 2011 he reported (without any further survey) that the fire probably started “below or beside the engine room control room, but not inside.” But if he had been in the purifier room and observed the damage there thoroughly he would surely have been more particular than simply referring to “below” the control room.  </p>

The Underwriters said that, since the only realistic source of fuel for the resurgent fire was the diesel oil service tank, the damage cannot have been done before the first fire. For if it had been done then there would have been no fuel for the resurgent fire from the diesel oil service tank. The Bank said that, if the fire did not resurge in the purifier room, then it is possible that the damage was done before the first fire, because there would be no need for diesel oil to fuel a resurgent fire in the purifier room. The Bank suggested (if the point on Captain Mockett’s report did not persuade the court) that the drain cock may have been “knocked off at the very outset” (see paragraph 499) with a “heavy implement” (see paragraph 501). Since I have concluded that, as both fire experts said, the purifier room is the most likely location for the resurgent fire because of the presence of diesel oil as the required additional fuel, the premise of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s (alternative) case falls away. Thus it is more likely than not that the damage to the drain cock was done after the first fire and before the fire resurged.     </p>

It was submitted on behalf of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> that entry into the engine room would have been “impossible or, at the very least, highly dangerous, being a confined space that was too hot for re-entry”. There can be no dispute that entry would have been dangerous. However, the evidence of physical damage suggests that someone entered the purifier room and caused physical damage allowing the release of diesel oil. The salvage experts described the task as difficult; and no doubt it would have been. But whilst I accept that the task was also hazardous and, as Dr. Mitcheson said, foolhardy, I am not persuaded that it was impossible for a person intent on adding fuel to the fire to enter the purifier and cause the damage shown in the photographs.  </p>

Dr. Mitcheson accepted that such fires as existed would probably go out that morning. But both experts accepted that the smoke seen in the afternoon of 6 July was indicative of an oil fire in the engine room. Dr. Craggs’ view was that oil must have been deliberately introduced and Dr. Mitcheson accepted that diesel oil must have been released in the purifier room to enable an oil fire to develop.

The second criticism was that there was more to the case than the photographs. Again, I do not consider that counsel can be criticised for cross-examining on the basis of the photographs. They were an important source of evidence as to what had happened.

That request is likely to have been made by Mr Paikopoulos who had arrived in Aden on 10 July 2011 with Mr. Iliopoulos. He said that the taking of the statements was the first thing he did after checking into his hotel. In cross-examination he admitted that some of the crew had mentioned “security” yet he made no mention of this in his report. It is true that three crew, including Mr. Artezuela (together with the cook and a messman), said in their first statements that the armed men were from security. But Mr. Artezuela changed his account in his later Manila statement. His first statement was not amongst those initially provided to the Underwriters. Indeed, I was told that it was only days before the Underwriters’ application to amend to plead wilful misconduct was heard it was provided to the Underwriters (along with 17 other manuscript statements of the crew made in Aden). That is consistent with a wish on the part of the Owner not to reveal to the Underwriters that the armed men had claimed to be “security”. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that had that been so the Owner would have ensured that the statements were destroyed and he did not do so. However, the Owner may have had reasons for keeping them and is unlikely to have contemplated that the Underwriters would learn of what the crew had told the USS PHILIPPINE SEA by means of documents obtained in 2013 through a request under the US Freedom of Information Act.  </p>

There had been no misrecollection then. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> supported the suggestion of misrecollection by suggesting that it was unlikely that there had been a request to change the crew’s evidence because, if there was the alleged conspiracy, the Owner would surely wish the account given by the crew to tally with the VDR.

It is, in my judgment, extraordinary that the master permitted armed men to board his vessel in an area where there was a risk of piracy when it must have been clear to him that, apart from the fact that they said they were “security”, there was nothing to suggest that they were and much to suggest that they were not,  namely, the fact that there had been no call from them, their number, the fact that they were armed and masked and the fact the security team were not expected until about 0500.  It is also extraordinary that the master permitted them to board without leaving his cabin. It is to be expected that he would have wished to proceed to the bridge immediately. (In this regard it is to be noted that <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s “suspect boat” drill provided for the master to be called to the bridge.) Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> said that this was an irrelevant matter because the execution of the alleged conspiracy would not be facilitated by the master remaining in his cabin. But that misses the point, which is that it is improbable that a master of a laden tanker adrift in the Gulf of Aden would remain in his cabin when a small boat containing armed men had come alongside his vessel and there was reason to believe they were not the security they claimed to be.      </p>

The alternative scenario would then require the master to be both very courageous in steering the vessel away from Somalia and also very fortunate in having on board members of the Yemeni coast guard who did not appreciate that the vessel was not being steered towards Somalia as instructed. Similarly the chief engineer would have to be both very courageous in deciding to stop the engines and also very fortunate in having armed guards who, although they saw him enter the purifier room, were unable to find him a short distance to the aft of the purifier room. The armed guards would have to have had the foresight to have brought on board an IEID (for use in an unintended eventuality) and yet to have lacked the foresight to bring on board a suitable accelerant. The main engine having been unexpectedly stopped, the alternative scenario would then require the armed men to be unable to find the chief engineer (and to be unwilling to seek assistance from another engineer officer), to decide to abandon their plan to hijack the vessel and instead (for whatever reason) to activate the IEID with minimal delay and then to have the good fortune to locate, with minimal further delay, a suitable accelerant in an unfamiliar engine room.

It reignited or resurged in the purifier room where the drain cock to the diesel oil tank had been deliberately damaged. It is probable that the drain cock was damaged after the initial fire and before the resurgent fire. Those circumstances are a cogent indication that the resurgence of the fire was deliberate because it is a reasonable inference from the damage to the drain cock that it was done to provide fuel for the fire. Further, the fact that the resurgent fire occurred in the purifier room indicates that it was deliberate because the only plausible fuel, namely diesel oil, must have been released deliberately, as the fire experts agreed.   </p>

No-one else was on board save possibly for the chief engineer. If he was on board it is probable that he assisted Poseidon.

Moreover, Mr. Vergos failed to mention the resurgence of the fire before 1230 on 6 July and instead suggested that as a result of boundary cooling of the accommodation, main deck and shell plating the fire had been brought under control by 1600 on 6 July. For a small, local salvor apparently engaged on the salvage of a major casualty, one would expect a comprehensive, detailed and accurate account of the salvage service. For such a statement would assist in Mr. Vergos’ claim for a substantial part of the salvage award as sub-contractor.   </p>

But if there had not been that would have invited comment. It was in any event ineffective, as the salvage experts agreed. Photographs were taken by Poseidon, some of which <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> damaging (for example those which show that the doors in the accommodation were not shut). But, although they were passed on to FOS, I do not consider that that is a cogent indication of Poseidon having nothing to hide. The absence of photographs showing the resurging of the fire is a cogent indication that they had something to hide. It was said that if Poseidon had been party to the alleged conspiracy they would want to be sure that they were employed as salvor yet instead “it was left in the gift of Five Oceans”. But it was Mr. Iliopoulos who telephoned Mr. Vergos in the early hours of 6 July instructing him to proceed. Their employment was thus not in the gift of FOS. Reliance is placed on the prompt response but, as I have explained, it was <span style="font-style:italic">remarkably</span> prompt. USS PHILIPPINE SEA made no adverse criticism of the fire fighting. But all that could be seen would be the boundary cooling. Finally it is said that the photographs show “a group of regional salvors excited by and proud of their salvage of a major casualty” and reliance is placed on Mr. Herrebout’s opinion that Poseidon “did what they needed to do to preserve the vessel and cargo as a whole.” But these points have to be considered in the light of the fact that the resurgence of the fire was caused deliberately when Poseidon were on site.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two indications of the involvement of Mr. Iliopoulos. First, there is the evidence of Mr. Pappas that Mr. Iliopoulos was active in the early hours of 6 July informing both FOS and Poseidon of the need for salvage assistance. Mr. Pappas said that Mr. Iliopoulos told him that the vessel was on fire. But how Mr. Iliopoulos knew that the vessel was on fire is not known. It is likely that Mr. Iliopoulos also told Mr. Vergos that the vessel was on fire. Second, those members of the crew involved with the arrival of the armed men who were asked (as I have found) to state in their early statements that the armed men announced they were “the authorities”, when that was not true, can only have been asked to do so by or on behalf of Mr. Iliopoulos. No one else would have a reason to make that request. That is a cogent indication of Mr. Iliopoulos’ involvement in the plot to set fire to the vessel.</p>

However, counsel for the Underwriters relied upon the findings made by Flaux J. that Mr. Iliopoulos, who gave evidence before Flaux J. over two days, had lied to the court when seeking to explain why he had not provided his solicitors with an electronic archive of documents. I have read Flaux J.s judgment. The findings are summarised between paragraphs 384 and 394 of the Underwriters’ closing. They are remarkable in that they show that Mr. Iliopoulos is prepared, not merely to lie to the court on oath, but to fabricate an entirely untrue story and to get associates to act out their false roles. These findings are indicative of his character. He is capable of dishonesty, telling elaborate lies and supporting them by charades in an endeavour to make the deception effective. I accept that it cannot be inferred from these findings that he scuttled his vessel but the findings are supportive of the case that he did. I accept counsel’s submission that the findings are “part of the mix when assessing the evidence as a whole; and its consequence is that there can be no default assumption that Mr. Iliopoulos acted honestly”.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">It was further submitted that it can be inferred from his refusal to hand over the electronic archive that it contained documents which would have damaged his case that there had been a genuine attack on his vessel by pirates. The case for drawing such an inference is that unless the archive contained damaging evidence it is difficult to see why Mr. Iliopoulos would have risked having his claim to $77 million struck out. As Flaux J. said, “the knowledge that there was or might be such damaging material would provide a powerful motive for unwillingness to disclose the archive”. It was noted by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> that Mr. Iliopoulos had in fact given considerable disclosure and it was suggested that the archive may have contained material which was embarrassing or confidential or which related to other vessels. But that is unlikely to be a reason for not providing his own solicitors with the archive. Irrelevant material need not be disclosed to the Underwriters. If there was truly confidential material which was irrelevant to the issues in the case his solicitors could make the appropriate application to the court. I consider it more likely than not that the archive did contain material which Mr. Iliopoulos feared would damage his case. That is the only realistic explanation of the risk he took that his valuable and substantial claim would be struck out. This adverse inference strengthens the Underwriters’ case against Mr. Iliopoulos. </p>

I accept that the risk of detection was significant, given the number of people involved. (Mr. Plakakis and Mr. Theodorou have suggested others in important roles but their evidence was the only evidence against those other persons.) However, Mr. Iliopoulos was prepared to run the risk that his valuable claim under the policy might be struck out if the court saw through his attempt to avoid disclosure of documents which he did not wish the Underwriters to see. Thus he is a risk taker.  The conspirators would require rewards and there is no evidence of the payments which must have been made by Mr. Iliopoulos. That is part of the canvas which is blank. But it has long been recognised that underwriters in cases such as the present cannot be expected to be able to light all parts of the canvas. Finally, it is said that the evidence from Mr. Plakakis that the major players in the conspiracy did not trust each other “belies any conspiracy”.

In the present case there was a risk, because the insured value was so high, that a total loss might not be achieved. But Mr. Iliopoulos was a risk taker; and he achieved a total loss. The decision to scuttle the vessel whilst fully laden was said to expose the Owner to liabilities for pollution but the salvage experts agreed that the cargo of fuel oil was not at risk of explosion. The choice of location was said to carry risk (close to shore, within the territorial waters of Yemen and in an area where there had been few attacks by pirates) but this observation tends to assume that those who seek to defraud will carry out their aims in a manner which will avoid all risks, including those of detection. That is not always so. But the chosen location also had advantages. Its proximity to Aden, at or about the limit of Yemeni territorial waters, enabled the armed men and Poseidon to reach it with minimal delay. It was said that there was a risk of an unseaworthiness claim by cargo interests which would lead to further scrutiny. But a disguised attack by pirates would reduce the risk of such a claim. There was risk of injury to those who activated the IEID but scuttling will often involve risks of injury to those involved; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Atlantik Confidence</span> [2016] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 525 at paragraph 309.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, there is the question of motive (see category (vi) at paragraph 447 above). The presence of a motive to scuttle may, depending upon the circumstances of the case, assist those who allege that a ship has been scuttled to prove their case. “…if there is a motive for dishonesty then it may assist in determining whether there has been dishonesty in fact” (per Aikens J. in <span style="font-style:italic">The Milasan</span> [2000] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 458 at paragraph 28(10)).

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case a number of matters stand out. First, as a result of the collapse of the freight market in 2008 the vessel was loss-making. Excluding depreciation and impairment charges (caused by the dramatic loss in the market value of the vessel) there had been reported operating losses of over $10 million between 2009 and mid2011. (Taking depreciation and impairment charges into account the reported losses were over $44 million.) Consistently with those reported losses Mr. Iliopoulos informed <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> in an email dated 21 December 2011 (more than 5 months after the casualty) that BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO was “running at an operating loss of total about $12 million” since 2009. The expert accountant for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> agreed that the vessel had been unable to contribute anything towards debt service and was a “cash drain”. Second, the accounting experts agreed that the evidence suggested that certain trade debts in respect of insurance, crew wages and bunkers were overdue in the period to 30 June 2011. Arrest had been threatened by bunker suppliers in February and June 2011 and was threatened on <abbr alert="" security="" ship="" system="" title="vessel operated the Ship Security Alert System (“&lt;abbr title=">SSAS</abbr>”) which informed various authorities"&gt;the vessel’s arrival in China. Third, the Owner had defaulted in respect of repayments of interest and capital due to <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>. Fourth, it was accepted by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s expert accountant that in the absence of funds lent by associated companies the Loan Group would not have been able to carry on trading. Fifth, the combined financial statements of the Loan Group for the year ended 31 December 2010 issued on 29 June 2011 contained a note entitled “Going Concern” which noted (a) that the companies show negative working capital, (b) are in default of their debt obligations and (c) the companies’ cash flow for 2011 is expected to be lower than in 2010. For the future it was planned (a) to reduce outstanding loan liabilities by the sale proceeds from two vessels, (b) to implement a cost cutting strategy and (c) to appoint a new manager to assist with chartering and to explore new trade areas for the vessels. The accountants, Deloitte, drew attention to this and said that the matters noted raised “substantial doubt” about the companies’ ability to continue as a going concern. Sixth, notices of default had been served by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>. In particular, on 18 February 2011 an interim “balloon” repayment of $4.652 million had not been paid and on 1 March 2011 a notice of default was served. The Bank referred to certain other matters and requested the Loan Group to “realise the seriousness of the situation and revert with immediate and concrete actions.” A further notice of default was issued following a failure to make a further payment on 15 March 2011. A letter raising a number of matters was sent on 28 March 2011 to which no reply was received. On 18 April 2011 a letter was sent addressed not only to the companies in the Loan group but also to Mr. Iliopoulos, described as “Personal Guarantor/Pledgor”. The Bank expressly put the addressees on notice “for the last time” that they had failed to make various payments  and that failing payment by 3 May 2011 <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> would be “entitled to proceed to any act for securing all or any of its rights and remedies under the contract, the law or otherwise without any further notice.” Thereafter, pursuant to a Supplementary Agreement, the balloon repayment was deferred until the end of July 2011.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In those circumstances the recovery of US$77 million upon a fraudulent insurance claim would be a clear financial or pecuniary advantage to the Owner.

I bear in mind that the Owner (by reason of his experience with the claim on the <span style="font-style:italic">Elli</span>) may well have foreseen a long investigation by the Underwriters and delay in resolution of the claim but I do not consider that that eliminates the prospect of a clear financial gain for the Owner. Even a long delayed recovery of US$77 million must on any view amount to a “hope of gain”.  Of course, it does not follow that the Owner scuttled the vessel.

The “time charter equivalent” earnings (TCE) were $5,568 in 2010 and $3,567 in the first six months of 2011. The case for saying that results were starting to improve depended upon the charterparty which BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO was performing at the time of the loss, the Solal charterparty, which was said to generate a profit of $1.4 million on discharge in China and so produce a TCE of $11,853. It is true that the freight rate achieved was higher than on the charters performed in the first 6 months of 2011. It is not clear why (though counsel for the Underwriters have suggested that the reason is connected with the charterers’ proposal that the bills of lading be changed to describe the cargo, falsely, as bitumen mixture, see below). Whether the expected net profit would have been achieved is also not clear. There was evidence of the cargo being contaminated by sea water. But even if the expected profit were achieved it would make little headway on the Loan Group’s current liabilities as at June 2011 of $26.5 million of which $11.19 million consisted of trade creditors. </p>

The answer to that debate can only be determined by considering whether the circumstances of the case as a whole enable the Underwriters to discharge the heavy burden which lies upon them to establish wilful misconduct by Mr. Iliopoulos.     </p>

But in circumstances where it was accepted by <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s expert accountant that there was no realistic prospect of BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO ever generating a return to shareholders (because of the magnitude of the finance debt and the age of the vessel) there is likely to have been a limit to the extent to which associated companies would continue to support the Owner.    </p>

But even if that is not conceded it seems to me that the claim held out the prospect of substantial financial gain. There was therefore a motive. Whether Mr. Iliopoulos attempted to procure that gain dishonestly, notwithstanding (i) the planned strategies to improve the financial position noted in the accounts, (ii) the Solal charterparty, (iii) the risk that there may be no recovery and (iv) the risk to Mr. Iliopoulos’ reputation, depends upon a consideration of all of the evidence in the case.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourth, the orchestrator of these events was the owner of BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO, Mr. Iliopoulos. It is improbable that the armed men, master, chief engineer and Mr. Vergos took part in the conspiracy on their own initiative. By contrast Mr. Iliopoulos had a motive to want the vessel to be damaged by fire, namely, the making of a fraudulent claim for the total loss of the vessel in the sum of some US$77 million which, if successful, would solve the serious financial difficulties in which he and his companies were at the time. Moreover, his involvement is consistent with his early telephone calls to FOS and Poseidon between 0300 and 0400 on 6 July reporting that the vessel was on fire and positively indicated by the striking coincidences that (i), although it is clear from the VDR audio record that the armed men identified themselves as “security”, almost all of the crew in their early statements said that the armed men identified themselves as “the authorities” and (ii) that the statements of those few crew members who said that the armed men identified themselves as “security” were amongst those not disclosed to the Underwriters until, some years later, the Owner’s solicitors disclosed them. Only Mr. Iliopoulos had reason for the crew to tell an untrue story. Thus the evidence relating to the loss, the crew’s untrue evidence in their early witness statements that the armed men described themselves as the authorities and Mr. Iliopoulos’ motive for setting fire to his vessel amount to a cogent and compelling case that the events were orchestrated by him. The case against him is strengthened by what is known of his character from the findings made by Flaux J. and by the inference that the documents he was unwilling to disclose would have supported the case against him. I have therefore concluded that Mr. Iliopoulos was the instigator of the conspiracy.    </p>

Was the recruitment of three unarmed security personnel a ruse to provide an explanation for the vessel drifting off Aden ? I consider that it is more likely than not that it was, notwithstanding that it appears to have been a genuine and costly arrangement. It is also more likely than not that the Owner drafted the letter from Anyland to sign confirming that the security team’s flight had been cancelled in order to support that ruse.

<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">Mr. Iliopoulos ? Again, on the balance of probabilities I consider that it was. The arrangement for the security personnel had only been finalised on 5 July. It is likely that there was a need for a last minute discussion as to the planned events. Both parties agree that the master and Owner would have known that conversations on the bridge were recorded. However, in circumstances where the words spoken by the Owner would not be recorded they probably thought that, in the interests of finalising the arrangements, the risk was worth taking. It was after this conversation that the master proceeded to a position at which he commenced to drift. But even if the master’s conversation at 2043 was not with the Owner I would still have reached the conclusions I have; for the events on board indicate very clearly what in fact happened.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.00in">p. 259, where it is said: 'Besides, though the absence of competent authority is the test of piracy, its essence consists in the pursuit of private as contrasted with public ends. Primarily the pirate is a man who satisfies his personal greed or his personal vengeance by robbery or murder in places beyond the jurisdiction of a State. The man who acts with a public object may do like acts to a certain extent, but his moral attitude is different, and the acts themselves will be kept within wellmarked bounds. He is not only not the enemy of the human race, but he is the enemy solely of a particular State.' That I think expresses what I have called the popular or business meaning of the word ' pirate,' and I find that several, though not all, of the definitions cited in the note on p. 260 of the same work bear out that idea. No doubt there are definitions which do not embody that idea, but that I think is the common and ordinary meaning; a man who is plundering indiscriminately for his own ends, and not a man who is simply operating against the property of a particular State for a public end, the end of establishing a government, although that act may be illegal and even criminal, and although he may not be acting on behalf of a society which is, to use the expression in Hall on International Law, politically organized. Such an act may be piracy by international law, but it is not, I think, piracy within the meaning of a policy of insurance; because, as I have already said, I think you have to attach to ' piracy' a popular or business meaning, and I do not think, therefore, that this was a loss by piracy."

To my mind the term "piracy" is inapplicable to the acts of the persons who seized the goods insured in this case, however wrongful or lawless their conduct may have been according to the law of Brazil or Bolivia. They seized these goods not for their private gain, but in furtherance of a political adventure in the latter country. I do not think that any business man would say that those acts constituted "piracy" in the sense in which that term is used in this policy.

In my judgment, whichever is the correct analysis, <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> is obliged to establish that the loss was caused by an act of piracy.  I do not consider that the nature or quality of the event which befell BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO differs whether it is looked at from the point of view of the Owner or of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>. When deciding whether there has been a loss by an insured peril the court must determine as a matter of fact the nature of the event which has caused the loss. The reason why the wilful misconduct of, or misrepresentation or non-disclosure by, one assured does not affect the ability of the other assured to recover under a composite policy is that the wrongful actions of the one are not wrongful actions of the other. There is no scope for the application of that principle when determining the nature of the event which has caused loss. In my judgment an attempted insurance fraud is not an act of piracy, whether looked at from the point of view of the Owner or of <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>.

Counsel for the Underwriters said that the armed men did not wish harm; they merely wished the crew out of the way. That is probably so but from the point of view of the crew the threats probably appeared real. I further accept that a threat of harm can signify “ill-will”.

But the purpose of the damage was not to frustrate the Owner’s ability to use the vessel to trade. The Owner had decided that he had no wish to continue trading the vessel and instead wished to render the vessel a total loss so that he could claim the insurance proceeds.

In the absence of the Aden Agreement the Underwriters were not on risk because the vessel had sailed for Yemeni territorial waters (“OPL Aden”) which were outside the navigational limits of the policy. But the Aden Agreement permitted the vessel to be in such waters. The Underwriters submitted that there were two reasons why they were not bound by the Aden Agreement. First, it was said not to apply on its true construction. Second, they had rescinded it on account of a misrepresentation.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Before considering the construction arguments it is first necessary to deal with the meaning of “OPL Aden”. The Bank’s expert on this issue considered that it referred to an area outside or off port limits and the Underwriters’ expert agreed that that was its most common meaning, though he said it could refer to “outer port limits”. In those circumstances the most likely meaning of OPL Aden, assessed on an objective basis, is off or outside port limits. But there remains the question, how far off or outside port limits is within the phrase OPL Aden ? On that issue I accept the submission made on behalf of the Underwriters, and supported by their expert, that the area outside or off port limits must, on an objective basis, have been intended to refer to an area in close proximity to the port limits. It is unlikely that the parties to the Aden Agreement envisaged that anywhere outside port limits was contemplated as being the place where the vessel was to anchor. There was evidence from <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s expert that the port limits of Aden were about 3.15 nautical miles from the coastline.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The submission made by counsel on behalf of the Underwriters was that on the true construction of the Aden Agreement it applied only for the purposes of the vessel proceeding to and remaining at a designated anchorage area at or in close proximity to the port limits where the vessel would benefit from the protection of the port (see paragraph 1849 of the Underwriters’ closing submissions). The further submission made was that in any event the vessel did not proceed to or remain at anchorage but chose instead to drift (see paragraph 1851). These submissions were resisted by counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> at paragraphs 1289-1304 of their closing submissions.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The written submission on behalf of the Underwriters, by referring to a “designated anchorage area” where “the vessel would benefit from the protection of the port” seems to me to go too far and to read words into the Aden Agreement which are not there. However, the request made to the Underwriters was to approve a call at “OPL Aden”. The question therefore is whether calling at a place initially about 11 miles off the coast (close to the limit of Yemeni territorial waters which were 12 miles off the coast) was a call at “OPL Aden”. Since the port limits were about 3.15 miles off the coast I do not consider that the place where the master chose to drift can, in the context of the Aden Agreement, realistically be referred to as close to the port limits. I accept the submission made by counsel for the Underwriters that the Underwriters “cannot sensibly be taken to have permitted the vessel to wait just inside Yemeni territorial waters, 10-12 miles from the port.” For some purposes it may be that a point 11 miles off Aden may be regarded as close to the port limits. But the context in question is one in which the Underwriters were being requested to permit the vessel to enter waters which were otherwise outside the navigational limits of the policy. In that context it is reasonable to expect that OPL Aden was intended to refer to a location quite close to the port limits (where the vessel can be expected to be relatively safe) rather than to a location about 8 miles distant from those port limits and almost in international waters.    </p>

The meaning of knowledge has perplexed philosophers from Plato (and no doubt before) to after A J Ayer, and been said by some to be ultimately unanswerable. But as a matter of law and everyday understanding some points are reasonably clear. First of all, I reject Miss Bucknall's submission that a party must be taken to know whatever he could properly plead. The submission cannot be accepted, even if attention is confined to dishonest conduct which, under the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales, requires a pleader to have " ... before him reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case." </p>

But I was persuaded that it did not and that the best guide to the meaning of knowledge in this context remained Mance J’s threefold test: (1) the matters said to be known must be true; (2) there must be a firm belief in their truth; and (3) there must be sufficient justification for that belief in terms of experience, information or reasoning. In the present case the matters said to be known are true, because the court has found them to be true. The Underwriters also had a belief in their truth because that was stated in the “statement of truth” at the end of the Amended Defence. The crucial question is whether that belief can fairly be described as firm and sufficiently justified by the information available to them at that time. The Underwriters had sufficient information to justify the pleading but in 2015 they had much less information than they have now. The particulars then available were pleaded under paragraph 33C of the Amended Defence. Counsel for the Underwriters were able to say in closing (see paragraph 1 of the written closing) that it was “obvious” that there had been wilful misconduct. I very much doubt that that could have been said in 2015 because so much more factual and expert evidence has since emerged. At that time, not only was the allegation of wilful misconduct denied, but the Owner argued that it was so hopeless that permission to amend to plead the allegation should not be granted. </p>

The consequence of making a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth are serious and CPR r 32.14 provides for proceedings for contempt to be brought in such circumstances. It is therefore important at the outset to identify what Part 22 does and does not require. In relation to a pleading the claimant or other relevant party who puts the document forward as a statement of his case is required to certify that he believes the facts alleged are true. He is not required to vouch for the legal consequences which he seeks to attach to these facts. That is a matter for argument and ultimately for the decision of the court. The purpose of Part 22 is simply to exclude factual allegations which to the knowledge of the claimant or other party are untrue or which the party putting forward the pleading to the court is unable to say are true. </p>

<p style="margin-left:1.00in;margin-right:1.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There may however be cases in which the claimant has no personal knowledge of the events which form the factual basis of the claim. Executors or liquidators of companies are obvious examples. They are often required to investigate matters years after they have occurred with a view to establishing a possible claim. In such cases the same rules of conduct will apply to those whom they instruct but a position will often be reached when the available evidence does not point clearly to any single factual possibility. In a case of alleged undue influence for example it may be possible to infer from the relative positions of the donor and donee coupled with the obviously disadvantageous nature of the transaction that some form of oppressive or abusive behaviour has occurred yet the precise form which the undue influence took can only be established, if at all, at the trial. The evidence at the pleading stage from various potential witnesses may disclose a number of possibilities. In such a case it seems to me perfectly legitimate for counsel with sight of that evidence to plead out those possibilities as alternatives. There will be evidence to support each plea. The determination of which, if any, of the possibilities was the probable cause is a matter not for the pleader but for the court at trial.” </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s principal submission was that if an insurer knows enough to avoid a contract of insurance he must also know enough to affirm the contract. Counsel submitted that when the Underwriters purported to avoid the Aden Agreement in September 2016 the information on which they relied was known to them in March and May 2015. Support for this approach is to be found in <span style="font-style:italic">Moore Large v Hermes Credit and Guarantee</span> [2003] Lloyds Insurance and Reinsurance 315 at paragraph 91 (per Colman J.) and in<span style="font-style:italic"> Coastal Estates Pty Ltd. v Melevende</span> [1965] VR 451. However, the question of whether or not a party had the necessary to degree of knowledge to support a case of affirmation is, as Mance J. said, very much a “jury question”. One must therefore be careful when using the facts of other cases to justify a factual finding in the instant case. Moreover, avoidance does not require knowledge in the same way that affirmation does and thus, whilst it may be relevant to enquire whether an insurer had sufficient information to avoid a contract when deciding whether the insurer had sufficient knowledge for the purpose of affirming the contract, it would be unsafe to use the suggested test in every case.  </p>

Such allegations are only proved by examination of a large number of matters, both factual and expert. Typically, they are hotly disputed and in the years and months leading to trial new pieces of evidence will be discovered which will refocus the argument. It will only be in rare cases that an underwriter who has sufficient evidence to allege scuttling and to state that he believes the allegation to be true can fairly be said to “know” that the allegation is true. Rather, the underwriter’s state of mind is one where the available evidence causes him so strongly to suspect scuttling that he feels justified in making the allegation and commits himself to proving it. It will only be after extensive disclosure, detailed examination of the principal witnesses and an assessment of the technical arguments by experts that he might be able to say that he has actual knowledge of scuttling. In the present case I do not consider that the Underwriters had that knowledge in 2015.  </p>

However, the Underwriters’ claims manager, Mr. Cunningham, and their solicitor Mr. Zavos gave evidence that they were not aware of the right to avoid the Aden Agreement until 2016. Their evidence was supported by the disclosure of (and waiver of privilege in respect of) an attendance note dated 14 July 2016 which referred to a “new defence …..that the extension of cover which had been granted on 5 July 2011 was voidable for nondisclosure of an intention to scuttle the ship.” In an email dated 18 July 2016 Mr. Zavos said that counsel had come up with this “new argument”.   </p>

Once the Owner’s claim had been struck out the focus of attention was directed to defeating <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr>’s claim and hence the Aden Agreement came into greater focus. But in any event a mistaken recollection seems improbable because, as Mr. Zavos said, if he had been aware of it earlier it would have been pleaded earlier.

Reliance was placed on <span style="font-style:italic">Liberian Insurance Agency v Mosse </span>[1977] 2 Lloyd’s Reports 560. It suffices to say that in that case Donaldson J.  held that a held covered clause only applied if the premium to be arranged would be such as could properly be described as a reasonable commercial rate and in the present case no underwriter, knowing the true reason for calling OPL Aden, would have agreed a premium. For this reason alone I am unable to accept the “held covered” argument.   </p>

<p style="margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">largely consists of guidance which is always subject to the discretion of the master.  Thus in the event of a dispute there must be an investigation into what was done or not done and the reasons why the master acted as he did. This must inevitably give rise to uncertainty as to whether, in the event of a loss, there is cover or not. Commercial entities generally prefer certainty to uncertainty. In my judgment the reasonable (commercial) man would construe the policy in such a way as to minimise the uncertainty to which the obligation to follow <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 gives rise. This approach is analogous to the approach of the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sea Glory Maritime Co. v Al Sagr National Insurance Co.</span> [2014] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 14 at paragraph 219 (which concerned a warranty that a vessel was ISM compliant) and <span style="font-style:italic">The Rowan</span> [2012] 1 Lloyd’s Reports 564 at paragraph 24 (which concerned a warranty that the vessel had the approval of major oil companies).

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The documentary record is to the effect that on 29 June 2011, just before the vessel entered <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr>, the chief officer of BRILLANTE VIRTUOSO carried out a risk assessment which was approved by the master and by Central Mare. The methodology employed was based upon Central Mare’s Risk Assessment Manual which was designed for safety matters, but not specifically for the security of the vessel from an attack by pirates. The assessment was curious for several reasons. First, the assessment of the risk to crew was that it was highly likely that on the voyage in question there would be multiple fatalities. Neither expert was able to understand how this assessment had been reached. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> accepted that this was “nonsensical”. Second, certain of the steps suggested to lessen the risks in question were already in place. This suggested that the assessment had been a “cut and paste” exercise from an earlier assessment or from <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 itself. Third, additional control measures were to be in place by 13 July 2011, by which time the vessel was expected to have left <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr>. These features caused Mr. Hussey to describe the assessment as “dysfunctional”. In truth it was not a real assessment. It was simply the production of a document, a paper exercise, done on the eve of entering <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr>.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">But Mr. Hussey also said that <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 did not require the risk assessment to be carried out in any particular manner and the fact that the master in fact took measures of selfprotection (for example, installing razor wire around the perimeter of the vessel and nominating a citadel) showed that there had been a genuine risk assessment at some point. Counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that this was self- evident, noted that Captain Cleaver accepted that there had been a risk assessment and relied upon Mr. Hussey’s evidence that the range of measures deployed was consistent with the vast majority of the merchant fleet at the time. Counsel for the Underwriters said that it was not selfevident that there had been a risk assessment because (i) the master and chief officer in their evidence relied solely on the paper exercise and (ii) the fact that the master took measures of self-protection is more consistent with the vessel installing what happened to be on board than with there having been an assessment of what was sufficient.    </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Ultimately I was persuaded that, on the balance of probabilities, there had been no genuine risk assessment as contemplated by <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3. I accept that <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 did not require the assessment to be in any particular form but it did require the assessment to consider<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>crew safety, freeboard, speed, sea state and pirate activity. In circumstances where the only evidence that such matters were taken into account was no more than a paper exercise it seems to me more probable than not that the chief officer and master did not make an assessment of the required matters in good faith but merely put in place such security measures as were available on board and had been used before and, just before entering <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr>, carried out a meaningless paper exercise to suggest that a genuine risk assessment had taken place. The previous risk assessment exercise conducted on 16 May 2011 for the northbound voyage through <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> was also dysfunctional in that it indicated certain risks as “intolerable” and yet no additional measures were taken. As counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted “it is inconceivable that the master would have been willing to put himself and his crew in harm’s way by knowingly running an intolerable risk”. That suggests that the previous risk assessment was also not genuine. Thus there appears to have been a culture on board the vessel of not carrying out a genuine risk assessment. The master is not solely to blame for this. The vessel’s managers received a copy of the northbound assessment and did not, it seems, query the intolerable risks. There is evidence that they noted “missing data” but they ought surely to have made a much more penetrating enquiry as to whether the master and chief officer were carrying out a genuine risk assessment in accordance with <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3.     </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The vessel’s Ship Security Plan contained, at paragraph 16.6.7, a list of steps to take where a suspect vessel approached the ship. This was in effect a contingency plan though it was not specific to a passage through <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> and, in certain respects, conflicted with other recommendations in <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 (for example, with regard to the switching off of upper deck lighting). Further, the documentary record showed that there was a practice on board the vessel of conducting security drills with the crew. One, conducted on 30 April 2011, was to prepare the crew for a suspect boat approaching the ship and another, conducted on 7 May 2011, was to prepare the crew for an attack by pirates. These indicate that a contingency plan for transiting <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> was in fact exercised and discussed with the crew. The chief officer (who was the deputy Ship Security Officer, the master being the Ship Security Officer) gave evidence in his written statement dated 4 September 2011 that there were monthly security meetings on board. He said the last was conducted “during the last week of June 2011”. He said that a record of the meeting was kept on board the vessel and sent ashore with a “technician”. The former record obviously did not survive the fire but the latter does not appear to have been disclosed by the Owner. The Bank did not have a copy. The failure of the Owner to disclose the written record of the last security meeting gives rise to a doubt as to the truthfulness of the chief officer’s evidence. However, his evidence that there were monthly security meetings is supported by the written records of security drills in April and May 2011 and so it is likely that his evidence is true. I therefore accept that there was a contingency plan for dealing with the risk of a suspect boat or a pirate attack in June 2011. Since that must have been shortly before transiting <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> I accept that it was for the purpose of transiting <abbr title="High Risk Area">the HRA</abbr> even though it was based upon the contingency plan set out in the Ship Security Plan. </p>

This latter omission was said to be significant because the experts agreed that UKMTO was the primary recipient.

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the master’s decision to drift rather than proceed up and down the coast at speed was surprising, given the advice in <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3 and what appears to me to be its good sense. Upon the assumption that the master was not party to the alleged conspiracy the master took the decision to drift for the reasons he gave. I do not regard those as being good or sufficient reasons for not following the advice in <abbr title="Best Management Practice">BMP</abbr> 3. The result of the decision (coupled with the fact that the engines, as a result of being on “short notice”, could not be started for about 20 minutes) was that the vessel was vulnerable to an attack by pirates. Captain Cleaver thought that the master’s decision was quite wrong. I find it impossible to disagree, notwithstanding Mr. Hussey’s evidence (which I am told was uncontested) that it is the practice for vessels to drift off ports in areas where there is a high risk of piracy such as off Nigeria. So, on the assumption to which I have referred, the master exercised his discretion unreasonably. However, I cannot say that he failed to consider the matter in good faith. I therefore do not consider, upon the assumption that the master was not party to the alleged conspiracy, that there was a breach in this regard.  </p>

If he had been on the bridge he would have been able to observe the boat himself and, if necessary, communicate with it by loudhailer. Those would be the very basic requirements of vigilance by the master. He did not make any attempt to comply with them. I do not consider that it can be said that the master endeavoured to ensure that there was a high state of vigilance by asking the second officer to check from the bridge. The vessel’s suspect boat drill recognised that it was essential for the master to investigate a suspect boat himself from the bridge.

The Owner’s agreement is apparent from an email from Mr. Agha of <abbr title="World Wide Green Tankers">WWGT</abbr> acting as Owner’s chartering manager dated 13 June. On 14 June the broker agreed that it was in “common benefit to not put anything in RECAP”.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The cargo was loaded on 23 June and bills were issued showing that fuel oil had been shipped. On 28 June the Charterers sent an email saying that they were to proceed with the change from fuel oil to bitumen mixture. The Owners were asked where the original bills were to be sent and the master was asked to change the stowage plan to show bitumen mixture. On the same day Central Mare instructed the master “not to disclose the load port documents as understand charterers want to re-issue cargo docs with cargo to be named as  bitumen mixture.”  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">On 1 July the Charterers informed Central Mare that “ALL documents which carry the name of fuel oil TO BE DESTROYED on board vessel once new set of documents is issued”. On the same day the Charterers sent “DRAFT of new documents to be issued as sent by load port agent to Master.” The drafts were dated 23 June 2011 and referred to bitumen mixture. Later that day Central Mare emailed the drafts to the master requesting him “to amend the cargo name”.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus there is no doubt that there was a conspiracy between the Owner and Charterer to alter the description of the cargo in the bills from fuel oil to bitumen mixture. The master said in his oral evidence that he would not sign such false bills and counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> have pointed out that on 4 July the master informed MSCHOA that the cargo was fuel oil. But it is apparent from the email correspondence that he had been instructed to sign replacement bills and it is more probable than not that he would do as instructed.  </p>

There was no evidence from the Charterers on this issue, but counsel for <abbr title="the Bank’s">the Bank</abbr> submitted that it is unlikely that the Charterers assimilated the content of Central Mare’s email on 6 July and fabricated a false email in the 44 minutes between Central Mare’s email sent at 0912 and the charterers’ response at 0956.   </p>

<p style="margin-left:0.50in;margin-right:0.00in;text-indent:0.5in">The Charterers were clearly willing to act dishonestly as the earlier emails show. A person willing to mis-describe cargo in replacement bills is probably able to fabricate a false email at short notice. I consider it more likely than not that the news of the event which had befallen the casualty caused the Charterers to rethink their plan to have the cargo mis-described. If the email of 4 July had been genuine I would have expected it to have been passed on that day. It was not. It is therefore more likely than not that the email had been falsely created on 6 July after the Charterers had received news of the casualty.  </p>
