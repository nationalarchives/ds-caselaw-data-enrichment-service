<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an application for judicial review brought in very sad and difficult circumstances. The Claimant has extremely severe physical symptoms stemming, so the balance of the available medical evidence indicates, from post traumatic stress disorder (“<abbr title="post traumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr>”) arising from traumatic events in her past, including abuse during childhood. She is seeking a ruling from this court to the effect that the Defendant (“the CCG”) has an obligation under section 3 of <ref canonical="2006 c. 42" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/42" type="legislation">the <ref canonical="2006 c. 41" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/41" type="legislation">National Health Service Act 2006</ref></ref> (“<abbr title="National Health Service Act 2006">the NHS Act</abbr>”) to provide her with accommodation, as part of the health care package with which it should provide her free of charge under the NHS. </p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The CCG denies that it is subject to such an obligation. It says that there are other routes by which the Claimant’s accommodation needs can be met, either by provision of suitable housing by a housing association (with rent paid for by housing benefit) or by provision of social housing by a local authority with responsibility for meeting her social welfare needs.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The legal issue of principle which the court is invited to determine on the present application is whether the Claimant has a right to provision of accommodation suitable to meet her needs as part of the free, non-means tested care which she receives from the NHS or whether her accommodation should be provided by one or other of these alternative routes, in the form of means tested welfare benefits.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Claimant has no significant assets and her medical condition is such that she cannot work, so she has a strong claim to be in receipt of appropriate means tested social assistance. However, she feels that she would have greater assurance about the accommodation options available to her if she can establish that the CCG has an obligation under section 3 of <abbr title="National Health Service Act 2006">the NHS Act</abbr> to provide her with accommodation. </p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This legal issue is of wider significance for the NHS. An obligation on NHS bodies to provide free of charge, non-means tested accommodation could, if it is extensive, represent a considerable drain on their resources. For that reason, the Secretary of State for Health has been granted permission to intervene in these proceedings.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground between the Claimant and the CCG, and the Secretary of State agrees, that, as a matter of general principle, the words “other accommodation” in section 3(1)(b) are capable of covering ordinary private residential accommodation (as distinct from accommodation in a hospital or a care home). Therefore, in appropriate circumstances, a CCG does have a power to pay for such accommodation under that provision. However, the CCG and the Secretary of State dispute the Claimant’s claim that in present circumstances the CCG is obliged to pay for a suitable flat for her.</p>

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Secretary of State has issued guidance entitled, “National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS-funded Nursing Care” (revised version, November 2012) (“the Framework Guidance”). This includes general guidance as to the approach to be adopted to deciding when an NHS body should provide and pay for accommodation, as part of a package of NHS healthcare, and when it is appropriate for local authorities to provide accommodation as part of the welfare services they provide under section 21 of the <ref canonical="1948 (11  12 Geo. 6) c. 29" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/29" type="legislation">National Assistance Act 1948</ref>. The Framework Guidance says this at paragraphs 33-35:</p>
</content>
</paragraph>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">“<span style="font-weight:bold">Primary Health Need</span></p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">33. To assist in deciding which treatment and other health services it is appropriate for the NHS to provide under the 2006 Act, and to distinguish between those and the services that LAs [local authorities] may provide under section 21 of the <ref canonical="1948 (11  12 Geo. 6) c. 29" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/29" type="legislation">National Assistance Act 1948</ref>, the Secretary of State has developed the concept of a ‘primary health need’. Where a person has been assessed to have a ‘primary health need’, they are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. Deciding whether this is the case involves looking at the totality of the relevant needs. Where an individual has a primary health need and is therefore eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the NHS is responsible for providing all of that individual’s assessed health and social care needs – including accommodation, if that is part of the overall need.</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">34. There should be no gap in the provision of care. People should not find themselves in a situation where neither the NHS nor the relevant LA (subject to the person meeting the relevant means test and having needs that fall within their eligibility criteria for adult social care <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">[…]</span>) will fund care, either separately or together. Therefore, the ‘primary health need’ test should be applied, so that a decision of ineligibility for NHS continuing healthcare is only possible where, taken as a whole, the nursing or other health services required by the individual:</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">a) are no more than incidental or ancillary to the provision of accommodation which LA social services are, or would be but for a person’s means, under a duty to provide; and</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">b) are not of a nature beyond which an LA whose primary responsibility it is to provide social services could be expected to provide.</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">35. There are certain limitations to this test, which was originally indicated in Coughlan [<span style="font-style:italic">R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p. Coughlan</span> <ref canonical="[2001] QB 213" href="#" isNeutral="false" type="case" year="2001">[2001] QB 213</ref>]: neither the CCG, nor the LA can dictate what the other agency should provide. Instead, a practical approach to eligibility is required – one that will apply to a range of different circumstances, including situations in which the ‘incidental or ancillary’ test is not applicable because, for example, the person is to be cared for in their own home. Certain characteristics of need – and their impact on the care required to manage them – may help determine whether the ‘quality’ or ‘quantity’ of care required is more than the limits of an LA’s responsibilities, as outlined in Coughlan:</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Nature</span>: This describes the particular characteristics of an individual’s needs (which can include physical, mental health or psychological needs) and the type of those needs. This also describes the overall effect of those needs on the individual, including the type (‘quality’) of interventions required to manage them.</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Intensity</span>: This relates both to the extent (‘quantity’) and severity (‘degree’) of the needs and to the support required to meet them, including the need for sustained/ongoing care (‘continuity’).</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Complexity</span>: this is concerned with how the needs present and interact to increase the skill required to monitor the symptoms, treat the condition(s) and/or manage the care. This may arise with a single condition, or it could include the presence of multiple conditions or the interaction between two or more conditions. It may also include situations where an individual’s response to their own condition has an impact on their overall needs, such as where a physical health need results in the individual developing a mental health need.</p>
</content>
</level>
<level>
<content>
<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Unpredictability</span>: This describes the degree to which needs fluctuate and thereby create challenges in managing them. It also relates to the level of risk to the person’s health if adequate and timely care is not provided.

<content>
<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The guidance here is very general. Mr Lock QC for the Claimant sought to suggest that paragraph 33 indicates that the CCG is obliged in the present case to pay for the Claimant’s accommodation. I do not agree. That paragraph has to be read in the context of the whole Framework Guidance. It is clear from the document as a whole that there is no presumption that if someone has healthcare needs and if provision of suitable accommodation would assist in meeting those needs, then the provision of that accommodation is the responsibility of an NHS body. Rather, the responsibility for meeting the accommodation part of the needs of the individual will require assessment of what may be available to them in terms of provision of suitable social housing by a local authority or their own ability to own or rent their own home (supported, as necessary, by welfare benefits such as housing benefit). </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The Framework Guidance makes it clear that NHS bodies and local authorities are supposed to co-operate in trying to identify the health and welfare needs of an individual and in trying to work out how between them they should meet those needs: see, e.g., paragraphs 166-171. Part 2 of the Framework Guidance sets out Practical Guidance on various matters, including how to approach the division of responsibility between NHS bodies and local authorities regarding meeting various aspects of need which an individual might have. Sections PG1 and PG2 provide as follows:</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">1.1 Local authorities have a duty to carry out an assessment of needs where someone appears to be in need of community care services, and a duty to provide services or support to meet assessed eligible needs. However local authorities cannot lawfully commission services that are clearly the responsibility of the NHS (e.g. care provided by registered nurses and services that the NHS has to provide because the individual is eligible for NHS continuing healthcare).”</p>

This is a complex area of law and there is no simple authoritative definition of what is beyond the responsibility of the local authority. The powers and duties of local authorities are a matter of Statute and case law, including the Coughlan Judgment.</p>

A local authority can fund this ‘nursing care’ provided it is both incidental and ancillary to the individual’s accommodation and of a nature that a local authority can be expected to provide.</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">85.1 Where someone is assessed as eligible for NHS continuing healthcare but chooses to live in their own home in order to enjoy a greater level of independence, the expectation in the Framework is that the CCG would remain financially responsible for all health and personal care services and associated social care services to support assessed health and social care needs and identified outcomes for that person, e.g. equipment provision (see PG 79), routine and incontinence laundry, daily domestic tasks such as food preparation, shopping, washing up, bed-making, support to access community facilities, etc. (including additional support needs for the individual whilst the carer has a break). However, people who choose to live in their own home may have additional community care needs which it may be appropriate for the LA to address subject to their local eligibility threshold and charging policy, e.g. assistance with property adaptation (see PG 79), support with essential parenting activities, support to access other community facilities, carer support services that may include additional general domestic support, or indeed any appropriate service that is specifically required to enable the carer to maintain his/her caring responsibilities (bearing in mind PG 89 below).</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">85.2 There is a range of circumstances in which CCGs have overlapping powers with other statutory organisations. Where this is the case, CCGs and other statutory bodies should work in partnership locally to determine how each partner’s responsibilities will be exercised. CCGs should not simply assume that another organisation will meet the need. Active liaison should take place. The needs appropriate for the CCG to meet will depend upon the circumstances of the individual case, having regard to the overall purpose of the health service – to improve physical or mental health, and to prevent, diagnose or treat illness.</p>

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">85.3 Where other agencies/organisations have potentially overlapping powers/responsibilities there should be a discussion between the parties involved. If someone is receiving NHS continuing healthcare in their own home their benefits are unaffected (although they will not be able to receive support from the Independent Living Fund). There is a range of everyday household costs that are expected to be covered by personal income or through welfare benefits (i.e. food, rent/mortgage interest, fuel, clothing and other normal household items). In addition, disability-related benefits (e.g. Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance) are intended to cover some disability-related costs. As individual circumstances will differ considerably, it is not possible to give hard and fast rules on how best to divide responsibilities where overlapping powers exist.

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">To my mind, that general indication in the Framework Guidance, and the guidance to similar effect in sections PG1, PG2, PG85 and PG88, makes considerable sense in the context of cases where NHS bodies, local authorities and other state agencies may all have overlapping powers in relation to meeting aspects of an individual’s needs. The NHS is subject to considerable and increasing pressure to provide health care, in the ordinary and central sense of that term, to the general population. The budgets of NHS bodies such as the CCG to deliver health care of that kind are under considerable pressure. If there are other ways in which other needs of an individual can be met, such as their need for accommodation, which do not divert resources from the NHS’s core mission to provide a universal health care service, it is legitimate to expect that there should be careful exploration of those means before recourse is made to NHS funds to meet those other needs. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, that is particularly so where the main mechanisms for meeting such other needs which have been in place for decades as part of the welfare state are means tested benefits (such as provision of social housing by local authorities or housing benefit) that involve a sharing of the burden of the cost of provision between the state and the individual who receives assistance (if they have any income or assets). That has been determined by Parliament to be the basic, fair way of meeting those sorts of needs. Accordingly, if the accommodation needs of an individual can be met by assistance in that way, without diversion of resources from the NHS, that is both fair to them and fair to others who look to the NHS to meet their health care needs. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the basic contextual background to scrutiny of a decision of a clinical commissioning group under section 3(1)(b) as to whether an individual has reasonable requirements which it is necessary for it to meet by means of provision of accommodation. Absent special circumstances, it will usually be difficult to say that a body like the CCG has acted unlawfully or irrationally in deciding that accommodation needs of an individual can and ought to be met through other avenues involving means-tested state provision, and not out of its own NHS budget. </p>

The same must be true, he says, if an NHS body can see that a person needs accommodation to assist in the treatment of health needs. It is irrelevant that the person in the latter case may be able to meet their accommodation needs out of their own resources (e.g. if they own their own home or can afford to rent their own home) or that those needs can be met by provision by others (e.g. by provision of social housing or payment of housing benefit). </p>

Dr Ralston had been visiting the Claimant regularly, but she now does not accept that she has a therapeutic relationship with him and will not discuss her physical and mental condition with him or consent to any examination.

Dr Ralston is now very worried about the Claimant’s health. He fears that if she does not receive appropriate care soon, she could suffer breakdown of her skin (bed sores etc), severe bowel dysfunction, postural pneumonia and urinary tract infection, each of which could lead to potential local and systemic infection which could result in death.</p>

The application was heard by McFarlane J (as he then was), sitting in private. On 5 March 2009 he handed down his judgment, in which he found that the Claimant generally had full mental capacity with respect to decisions regarding her health care, although he also found that in certain very specific circumstances, if she were admitted to hospital for emergency treatment, she would at that point lack capacity and would be unable to make rational choices as a consequence of her <abbr title="post traumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr>. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lock submitted that there might be problems in securing continuation of housing benefit sufficient for the Claimant to pay rent to <abbr title="Housing Association">Midland Heart</abbr> if she moved to a larger flat with a spare bedroom which could accommodate a carer staying with her overnight. After the hearing, he sent the court a copy of regulation 9 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006. He suggested that by virtue of this provision the Claimant would not be entitled to housing benefit if she moved, because she would then be in “residential accommodation” (regulation 9(1)(k)). This is defined to include accommodation provided “in a care home” (regulation 9(4)(a)). Mr Lock’s suggestion was that if the Claimant went into a new flat with care being provided as well, that would count as a care home, and housing benefit could not be paid. He relied on <span style="font-style:italic">R (Moore) v Care Standards Tribunal</span> <ref canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 627" href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/627" isNeutral="true" type="case" year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 627</ref>; <ref canonical="[2005] 1 WLR 2979" href="#" isNeutral="false" type="case" year="2005">[2005] 1 WLR 2979</ref> in support of this suggestion. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lock primarily based his submission on the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Moore</span>. But <span style="font-style:italic">Moore </span>was a case concerned with very different facts and a different issue arising in the context of different legislation. In that case, the claimants had severe learning difficulties which required them to receive extensive nursing and personal care and were long-term residents of registered care homes. The registered owner of the homes, F Ltd, transferred the freeholds of the homes to another company, H Ltd, which granted each of the claimants an assured tenancy. F Ltd continued to apply the same care as before at the homes. F Ltd applied to deregister the houses as care homes, contending that the accommodation element was now provided by a tenancy granted by H Ltd, so that the homes ceased to be care homes for the purposes of the <ref canonical="2000 c. 14" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>. The application to deregister was refused by the relevant regulatory body and the tribunal, and F Ltd’s application for judicial review was dismissed. It was accepted for the purposes of the appeal that H Ltd and F Ltd, together with each house, were an establishment (see [21]). Since the Act defined a care home as an establishment, the Court had no difficulty in concluding that the relevant houses should continue to be registered as care homes. I did not find the case of assistance as a guide for resolution of the issues before me.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, I do not think that it can possibly be the case that the provision of any element of health care at all at a person’s own home has the effect of converting their home into a “care home”, with the effect that they lose the right to housing benefit and with the further effect that the full cost of their accommodation is forced upon the NHS. That is not something that happens in practice. It would in my view involve a bizarre interpretation of the concept of “care home” in <abbr title="National Health Service Act 2006">the NHS Act</abbr> and the Housing Benefit Regulations. It was unclear whether even Mr Lock was seeking to go that far in his submissions. In the periods when the Claimant has been in receipt of health care services at her home, she does not suggest that she lost her right to housing benefit for those periods. </p>

It is not known whether the care with which the Claimant requires to be provided will involve round-the-clock attendance, whether it will be at the same level as the care being provided in the <span style="font-style:italic">Moore</span> case or whether something less will be sufficient. I note that the health authorities in Wiltshire did not accept that there was a need for round-the-clock care, when the Claimant moved there. The CCG has not yet been able to assess the Claimant’s care needs, other than in a very general way, because of her resistance to co-operating with it as a result of her <abbr title="post traumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr>. She has not been subject to any recent, full medical examination. All the medical reports about her which I was shown were prepared some years ago. The most recent report, of a psychiatrist called Dr Dhar, dates from October 2011. The Claimant has in fact been living for many years in her flat without 24 hour care. </p>

However, he presented no detailed argument about this and I was left unpersuaded that there was any real difficulty here. Further, if necessary, the CCG has offered to consider paying the amount of any shortfall between housing benefit payable to the Claimant if she moves to a new flat with <abbr title="Housing Association">Midland Heart</abbr> and the rent payable for that flat.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If the Claimant has relevant mental capacity in relation to decisions regarding her accommodation, then the CCG’s decision to date that it does not consider it necessary to meet the reasonable requirements of the Claimant that it should provide accommodation under section 3(1)(b) of <abbr title="National Health Service Act 2006">the NHS Act</abbr> would in my judgment be lawful. It could assess that the Claimant has no “reasonable requirement” of accommodation to be provided by the CCG if she has made a free choice not to try to find a larger flat for herself. Further, the CCG could also assess that it is not “necessary” for it to provide her with accommodation, where she already has accommodation and has made a free choice not to pursue other avenues open to her to find better accommodation. On the footing that the Claimant has capacity, if she was acting reasonably she would have co-operated with <abbr title="Housing Association">Midland Heart</abbr> and the relevant housing authorities to try to find out if they could provide her with suitable accommodation, without having to call on the resources of the NHS to meet her need for accommodation.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">If, on the other hand, the Claimant does not have mental capacity in relation to decisions regarding her accommodation, then the CCG is lawfully entitled to consider that the appropriate way forward is to seek to raise the question of the Claimant’s mental capacity in the relevant forum, the Court of  Protection. This is what it is seeking to do, to resolve the uncertainty in which it finds itself. Proceedings in the Court of Protection can be conducted with appropriate speed, where important decisions are in issue. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The proceedings in the Court of Protection offer a real prospect that, if the determination is that the Claimant lacks relevant capacity, that Court can take steps on her behalf to carry forward the exploration of the possibilities for provision of accommodation by <abbr title="Housing Association">Midland Heart</abbr> or housing authorities outside the West Midlands which this court contemplated should happen, pursuant to the order made by Lewis J in November 2013. Since that can now be done, it is still too early to say that the CCG is bound in law under section 3(1) of <abbr title="National Health Service Act 2006">the NHS Act</abbr> to find that Claimant has a reasonable requirement of accommodation which needs to be met out of NHS resources. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">In the very unusual, sensitive and difficult circumstances of this case, I consider that the CCG acted with reasonable promptness to refer the Claimant’s case to the Court of Protection. It acted once it became clear that, despite an early indication via the Claimant’s solicitors that she would co-operate as required pursuant to the order made by Lewis J, in fact she would not and Dr Ralston became extremely concerned about her. An application to the Court of Protection was not something to be undertaken lightly, particularly when there had been a prior ruling of that Court which suggested that in 2009 the Claimant did have relevant mental capacity. </p>
