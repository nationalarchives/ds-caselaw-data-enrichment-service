<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">3.</span>
<marker name="tab"/>
<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The application is supported by a witness statement of Mr Richard Dingwall, setting out the relevant litigation history on which the Attorney-General relies, and documents annexed to it.

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The defendant, a member of the Bar, has represented herself before us.

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There can in fact be little dispute as to the steps taken by way of commencement of litigation and applications and other procedural steps taken by the defendant in the litigation, since they appear from the documents which have been exhibited to Mr Dingwall's witness statement.

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The litigation on the basis of which the Attorney-General seeks this order has related broadly to three matters, referred to as "the probate litigation", "the possession proceedings" and "the mortgage company claim".

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The probate litigation concerned and concerns the estate of the defendant's deceased husband, the late Chief Bashorun Moshood Olawale Abiola.  He died on 7th July 1998.  The defendant has been involved in disputes before the courts as to the validity or otherwise of wills purportedly duly executed by him.  The first will, which was the subject of dispute, was a will dated 25th October 1989.  The defendant challenged the validity of that will, alleging that it was a forgery.  On 4th August 2000 District Judge Conn rejected her claim.  She appealed to Hughes J.  There was a contested hearing before Hughes J, which resulted on 19th January 2001 in the dismissal of her appeal from the decision of District Judge Conn.  The defendant sought permission to appeal from the order of Hughes J, and on 27th July 2001 the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Giving judgment, Thorpe LJ referred to the allegation that the judge had adopted an incomplete or hybrid procedure involving only one live witness, a Mr Timpson, the solicitor who had taken instructions from the deceased and prepared the will for execution.  Thorpe LJ said:</span>

<p class="Parenthetical" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.80in;margin-right:0.51in;text-indent:-0.10in">
<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">"It is plain that the judge took that course out of his determination to avoid injustice and to give to Princess Abiola every opportunity to test Mr Timpson's evidence and to ensure that she left the court with a feeling that there had been a proper investigation and a profound investigation before the dismissive order of the district judge was upheld.  It is very plain from the transcript of the evidence that Princess Abiola was in an extremely disturbed state before the judge and the judge dealt with her on that day with obvious sensitivity as well as fairness.  His judgment runs to some 20 pages and explains with inexorable judicial logic why the princess's challenge to the will of her deceased husband was absolutely doomed to failure, despite the fact that she had obtained evidence in which she had invested a good deal of belief.  There was evidence from someone who asserted that the deceased had not been in England on the day that the will was executed.  There was a handwriting expert's statement which sought to doubt the validity of the decease's signature.  All this material the judge considered very carefully and equally carefully explained why he could not possibly stand against the very plain evidence of execution and attestation."</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Notwithstanding the rejection of her challenge to the 25th October 1989 will, the defendant obtained grant of letters of administration on the basis that Chief Abiola had died intestate.  That grant was declared null and void in the Principal Registry of the Family Division on 13th November 2001.  Evidently the grant of letters of administration was inconsistent with the decision of Hughes J, which had been so emphatically affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The administrators of the 1989 will sought a pronouncement in the High Court as to the validity of the 1989 will as against the 1994 will.

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 25th June 2003 Lawrence Collins J heard an application by the administrators of the 1989 will for permission to make payments and distribute money from the estate.  The application was again contested by the defendant, who suggested that proceeds of sales of shares in a company referred to as DHCL could not be disposed of because they had been transferred to her during Chief Abiola's lifetime.  The judge granted the permission sought by the administrators.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Subsequently, on 9th July 2003, the defendant issued a claim in the Chancery Division seeking a declaration that she was entitled to a share in the proceeds of sale of those shares.  That claim was dismissed on an application for summary judgment by the administrators on 3rd September 2003.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">"19.  I am satisfied on the facts adduced in evidence before us that Mr Barker has instituted vexatious civil proceedings.  'Vexatious' is a familiar term in legal parlance.  The hallmark of a vexatious proceeding is in my judgment that it has little or no basis in law (or at least no discernible basis); that whatever the intention of the proceeding may be, its effect is to subject the defendant to inconvenience, harassment and expense out of all proportion to any gain likely to accrue to the claimant; and that it involves an abuse of the process of the court, meaning by that a use of the court process for a purpose or in a way which is significantly different from the ordinary and proper use of the court process.  Those conditions are in my view met in this case.  Many of the proceedings show no justiciable complaint and, as has been pointed out, several writs have been issued against individual officers in the same department when one writ would have served against them all. </span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">22.  From extensive experience of dealing with applications under s 42 the court has become familiar with the hallmark of persistent and habitual litigious activity.  The hallmark usually is that the plaintiff sues the same party repeatedly in reliance on essentially the same cause of action, perhaps with minor variations, after it has been ruled upon, thereby imposing on defendants the burden of resisting claim after claim; that the claimant relies on essentially the same cause of action, perhaps with minor variations, after it has been ruled upon, in actions against successive parties who if they were to be sued at all should have been joined in the same action; that the claimant automatically challenges every adverse decision on appeal; and that the claimant refuses to take any notice of or give any effect to orders of the court.  The essential vice of habitual and persistent litigation is keeping on and on litigating when earlier litigation has been unsuccessful and when on any rational and objective assessment the time has come to stop." </span>

Happily in this case that is obviously not necessary, since he is a party to the litigation and he can obviously make up his mind, wearing another hat as it were, in relation to what should happen to the further investigation of these matters you have raised.  But I am bound to say, too, that in the Attorney-General's other capacity as the Head of the Bar, it does seem to me that some thought ought to be given in that direction.</span>
