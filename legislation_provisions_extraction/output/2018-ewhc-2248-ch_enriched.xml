<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">This is the hearing of separate applications made by each of the defendants. By an application notice dated 14 December 2017 the second defendant seeks an order (a) for summary judgment pursuant to CPR 24.2 (b) strike out of the claim pursuant to CPR 3.4 (2) (a) or (b). The application is supported by a witness statement of Ruth Greening, solicitor, at the defendants’ solicitors, CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP (CMS) dated 13 December 2017. By application notice dated 8 February 2018 the first defendant seeks an order in the same terms. The application is supported by the second witness statement of Ruth Greening dated 8 February 2018. </p>

<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant alleges that the first defendant received the sum of CHF 3 million (“<abbr title="sum of CHF 3 million">the Sum</abbr>”) in the form of a SWIFT transfer from Bank Mirabaud in Montreal on 13 March 2008. The Sum was paid into the account of Centurion Management Services Ltd (“<abbr title="Management Services Ltd">centurion</abbr>”), in accordance with <abbr title="relies on a SWIFT message">the SWIFT message</abbr>, but the claimant says that ultimately it should have been paid to him.  The Sum was paid away by <abbr title="Management Services Ltd">centurion</abbr> and never received by the claimant. The claimant brings a claim for restitution to “put the position back where it should have been and would have been if no transaction had been undertaken prior to 13 March 2008”. The amount claimed on the claim form, which was issued on 13 July 2017, is CHF 3 million which is said to have a value in sterling of £2,401,904.53. The second defendant appears to have been included in the claim on the basis that they are the holding company of the first defendant.</p>

This is not disputed by the claimant. The first defendant replied on 12 February 2015 stating that they could not assist. They reminded the claimant that they owe a duty of confidentiality to their customers and cannot disclose information to third parties unless compelled to do so by court order. Nothing further was heard until the claimant wrote to the defendants by letter dated 8 May 2017 when he informed them that he had made an application to  the High Court for disclosure of the Account. It does not appear that the application was ever issued.</p>

Mr Schenk transferred the first tranche, CHF 3 million into the control of the  Schenk defendants with a view to the bonds  being acquired. Mr Schenk used his father’s account to facilitate this but it was his money. No such bonds were ever acquired. Almost immediately the bulk of the money was either paid to <abbr title="records that Mr Schenk was induced by six named defendants">the Schenk defendants</abbr> or dissipated through a series of corporate vehicles ultimately owned by various of <abbr title="records that Mr Schenk was induced by six named defendants">the Schenk defendants</abbr>.

Mr Cook, the first Schenk defendant, and the claimant attended that meeting on behalf of <abbr title="records that Mr Schenk was induced by six named defendants">the Schenk defendants</abbr> with Mr Schenk’s lawyer. Mr Schenk was told that his funds have been invested in the shares of a company, <abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr> Leader plc (“<abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr>”), which was to be readmitted to the PLUS stock exchange the next day. <abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr> was said to be the owner of a patent application which would prove very profitable in the oil and gas sector. It was represented to Mr Schenk that forthwith upon listing, shares in <abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr> would be sold and he would receive by way of return a sum  representing a substantial profit on the investment. This agreement was set  out in writing and made between ANA Holdings and Mr Schenk. In fact no shares had been acquired for the claimant and in any event the <abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr> shares were subject to a lock-in agreement which precluded them from being sold for 12 months following trading. Further when <abbr title="Leader plc">Fluid</abbr> was admitted to listing its performance plummeted and its shares were suspended in 2009.

<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">18. The purpose of a pleading or statement of case is to inform the other party what the case is that is being brought against him. It is necessary that the other party understands the case which is being brought against him so that he may plead to it in response, disclose those of his documents which are relevant to that case and prepare witness statements which support his defence. If the case which is brought against him is vague or incoherent he will not, or may not, be able to do any of those things. Time and costs will, or may, be wasted if the defendant seeks to respond to a vague and incoherent case. It is also necessary for the Court to understand the case which is brought so that it may fairly and expeditiously decide the case and in a manner which saves unnecessary expense. For these reasons it is necessary that a party's pleaded case is a concise and clear statement of the facts on which he relies; see Spencer v Barclays' Bank 30 October 2009 per Mr. Bompas QC at paragraph 35. The Amended Particulars of Claim are, perhaps, concise but they are not clear or coherent. The transactions which the Defendant is alleged to have conducted in the name of the company without disclosing his conflict of interest and which have caused loss have not been clearly identified. The Further Information could perhaps have cured these defects but it has not done so. The particular transactions cannot be identified with ease. Moreover, additional claims, not foreshadowed or pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim, appear to have been added. They have no place in the Further Information since they had not been pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim. Further, evidential material has been added in such a way as to make comprehension of the Further Information difficult. </p>

If the Amended Particulars of Claim are not struck out there is a very real risk that unnecessary expense will be incurred by the Defendant in preparing to defend allegations which are not pursued, that he will be impeded in his defence of allegations which are pursued and that the Court will not be sure of the case which it must decide.”</p>

Furthermore he has failed to address the limitation defence that the first defendant has pleaded. Further this is all set in the now known factual matrix and the claimant’s role in the fraud perpetrated on Mr Schenk. I also accept Mr Temple’s submissions that the pleadings are sufficiently incoherent or vague and plead allegations of dishonesty without any particulars or evidence in support and that they are likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings. I allow the first defendant’s application both for summary judgment and in the alternative strike out of the claim under (a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim and (b) that the statement of case is likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings. </p>

The claimant has sought to support his case that the second defendant is a relevant party by setting out his understanding of the RBS group structure and referring to the fact that the RBS group and RBS group members are parties to legal proceedings, investigations and regulatory matters in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other jurisdictions.

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant asserts that there was “a failure by the second defendant to oversee the  KYC procedure of the offshore banking arm”, the first defendant. He sets out no basis in common law or in statute for a duty to be imposed on the second defendant to oversee an overseas subsidiary.  </p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant asserts that the second defendant “would have an input with processes followed in that regard to its subsidiaries”. This is wrong. There is no basis for asserting that the holding company was involved in the processes of its subsidiary, still less that even if there was such involvement it would give rise to a duty of care owed to the claimant.</p>

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant asserts that he is entitled to pierce the corporate veil and alleges that the business of the second defendant is no different from that of the first defendant. This argument is bound to fail given the separate legal personalities of the defendants and the very limited circumstances in which the corporate veil may be pierced.

<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.5in">In his part 18 response the claimant suggested that he would rely upon “assignment of liability and contributory negligence and the sometime described doctrine of the last clear chance”. There has been no assignment of liability and contributory negligence is inapplicable. In the absence of any elucidation by the claimant I do not know to what he is referring.</p>
